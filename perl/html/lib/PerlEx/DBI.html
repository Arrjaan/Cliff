<p>Note to Apache users: PerlEx::DBI is based on Apache::DBI.  Except for
the configuration noted above, PerlEx::DBI is functionally identical
to Apache::DBI.</p>
<p>You do NOT need to change anything in your scripts. The usage of this
module is absolutely transparent!</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This module transparently initiates persistent database connections.</p>
<p>The database access must be via the DBI module. For supported DBI drivers
see:</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI/">http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI/</a></pre>
<p>When the DBI module is loaded by your script (do not confuse this with
the loading of the PerlEx::DBI module itself) DBI looks at the environment
variable GATEWAY_INTERFACE and checks to see if it starts with 'CGI-Perl',
and whether an Apache::DBI compatible module (in this case PerlEx::DBI)
has been loaded.  If that is the case, every connect request will be
forwarded to the Apache::DBI compatible module.</p>
<p>PerlEx::DBI then looks at whether a database handle from a previous
connect request is already cached and whether the cached handle is still
valid, using the ping method.  If these two conditions are fulfilled it 
just returns the cached database handle.  The parameters defining the
connection have to be exactly the same for a cached handle to be selected,
including the connect attributes.  If there is no appropriate database
handle or if the ping method fails, a new connection is established and
the handle is cached for later re-use.  There is no need to remove any
<code>disconnect()</code> calls from your code.  They won't do anything because 
the PerlEx::DBI module overloads the disconnect method.</p>
<p>The PerlEx::DBI module still has a potential limitation: it keeps database
connections persistent on a per-interpreter basis. This means that if a
user accesses a database several times, the http requests may end up
being handled by different PerlEx interpreters, even though PerlEx tries
to use as few interpreters as possible.  In this case, every interpreter
needs to do its own connect.  It would be nice if all interpreters could
share the database handles, but currently this is not possible because of
strict isolation of the data space of interpreters, for scalability
and security reasons.  Also, it is currently not possible to create a
database handle upon PerlEx startup and later inheriting this handle in
every subsequent interpreter.</p>
<p>With these limitations in mind, there may be some scenarios where the usage
of PerlEx::DBI may not be worthwhile.  Consider a heavily loaded web
site where every user connects to the database with a unique userid.
This could cause many database handles to be initialized and kept persistent,
hogging database resources.</p>
<p>If you find that PerlEx::DBI results in consumption of excess database
resources, you should investigate enabling the native connection pooling
features of your database instead of enabling PerlEx::DBI for your scripts.</p>
<p>Another potential problem are timeouts: some databases disconnect the client
after a certain period of inactivity.  PerlEx::DBI normally tries to
validate the database handle using the ping-method of the DBI-module.
This method returns true as default.  If the database handle is not valid
and the driver has no implementation for the ping method, you will get
an error when accessing the database.  To work around this, you can try
to replace the ping method by any database command, which is cheap and
safe, or you may deactivate the usage of the ping method (see CONFIGURATION
below).</p>
<p>Here is a generalized ping method, which can be added to the driver module:</p>
<p>{   package DBD::xxx::db; # ====== DATABASE ======
    use strict;</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> ping </span><span class="operator">{</span>

            <span class="comment"># adapt the select statement to your database:</span>
            <span class="variable">$ret</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="variable">$dbh</span><span class="operator">-&gt;</span><span class="variable">do</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="string">'select 1'</span><span class="operator">);</span>
        <span class="operator">};</span>
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$@</span><span class="operator">)</span> <span class="operator">?</span> <span class="number">0</span> <span class="operator">:</span> <span class="variable">$ret</span><span class="operator">;</span>

    <span class="operator">}</span>
</pre>
<p>Transactions: a standard DBI script will automatically perform a rollback
whenever the script exits. In the case of persistent database connections,
the database handle will not be destroyed and hence no automatic rollback 
occurs.  While at first glance it might seem practical to handle a transaction 
over multiple requests, this will not really work because different requests
may be handled by different interpreters.  One interpreter will not know the
state of a specific transaction which has been started by another interpreter.</p>
<p>In general it is good practice to perform an explicit commit or rollback at
the end of every script.  In order to avoid inconsistencies in the database
in case AutoCommit is off and the script finishes without an explicit
rollback, the PerlEx::DBI module uses a cleanup handler to issue a rollback
at the end of every request.  Note that this cleanup handler will only be
used if the initial data_source sets AutoCommit = 0. It will not be used
if AutoCommit is turned off after the connect has been done.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="configuration">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<p>PerlEx::DBI should be loaded upon startup of a PerlEx Interpreter Class.
This can be done either by adding the following switch to the
CommandLineOptions registry setting:</p>
<pre>
    -mPerlEx::DBI</pre>
<p>or by adding the following line to the StartupCode setting such that
it executes before anything else that loads the DBI module:</p>
<pre>

    <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">PerlEx::DBI</span> <span class="operator">();</span>
</pre>
<p>Either of the above can be set within an Interpreter Class to restrict
the setting to a single script or a set of scripts under a given location.
See the PerlEx documentation for more information on these registry
settings.</p>
<p>Note that it is important to load PerlEx::DBI before any other modules
using DBI!</p>
<p>There is one configuration which is server-specific and which can be done 
within the script after $data_source has been initialized:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="variable">PerlEx::DBI</span><span class="operator">-&gt;</span><span class="variable">setPingTimeOut</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$data_source</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="variable">$timeout</span><span class="operator">);</span>
</pre>
<p>This configures the usage of the ping method, to validate a connection. 
Setting the timeout to 0 will always validate the database connection 
using the ping method (default). Setting the timeout &lt; 0 will de-activate
the validation of the database handle. This can be used for drivers which 
do not implement the ping-method. Setting the timeout &gt; 0 will ping the 
database only if the last access was more than timeout seconds before.</p>
<p>To enable logging, set the Trace value for your Interpreter Class
to 1 or higher.  Setting the variable to 1 simply reports every new
connect.  Setting Trace to 2 enables full debug output.</p>

<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</p>
<pre>
    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</pre>
<p>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.</p>
<p>If a message can be controlled by the <code>warnings</code> pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.</p>
<p>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <strong>-w</strong>
and <strong>-W</strong> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code>
to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlvar.html">the perlvar manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <code>warnings</code> pragma or the <strong>-X</strong> switch.</p>
<p>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#eval">eval in the perlfunc manpage</a>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <code>warnings</code> pragma.
See <a href="../../lib/warnings.html">the warnings manpage</a>.</p>
<p>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="accept" class="item"><code>accept()</code> on closed socket %s</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#socket"><code>socket()</code></a> call?  See
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#accept">accept in the perlfunc manpage</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="allocation_too_large_x" class="item">Allocation too large: %x</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#pack"><code>pack()</code></a> or <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#unpack"><code>unpack()</code></a> only
after certain types.  See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#pack">pack in the perlfunc manpage</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="s" class="item">Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>
<p>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <code>use subs</code> pragma).</p>
<p>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <code>CORE::</code> prefix
on the operator (e.g. <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#log"><code>CORE::log($x)</code></a>) or declare the subroutine
to be an object method (see <a href="../../lib/pods/perlsub.html#subroutine_attributes">Subroutine Attributes in the perlsub manpage</a> or
<a href="../../lib/attributes.html">the attributes manpage</a>).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="ambiguous_range_in_transliteration_operator" class="item">Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(F) You wrote something like <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr/a-z-0//</code></a> which doesn't mean anything at
all.  To include a <code>-</code> character in a transliteration, put it either
first or last.  (In the past, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr/a-z-0//</code></a> was synonymous with
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr/a-y//</code></a>, which was probably not what you would have expected.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="ambiguous_use_of_s_resolved_as_s" class="item">Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W ambiguous)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="ambiguous_use_of_c_resolved_as_operator_c" class="item">Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W ambiguous) <code>%</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, and <code>*</code> are both infix operators (modulus,
bitwise and, and multiplication) <em>and</em> initial special characters
(denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something
like <code>*foo * foo</code> that might be interpreted as either of them.  We
assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try to make it more
clear -- in the example given, you might write <code>*foo * foo()</code> if you
really meant to multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="ambiguous_use_of_c_s_resolved_to_c_s" class="item">Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>@{foo}</code>, which might be
asking for the variable <code>@foo</code>, or it might be calling a function
named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference.  If you wanted
the varable, you can just write <code>@foo</code>.  If you wanted to call the
function, write <code>@{foo()}</code> ... or you could just not have a variable
and a function with the same name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="ambiguous_use_of_c_s_resolved_to_c_s2" class="item">Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</a></strong></dt>

<dt><strong><a name="ambiguous_use_of_c_s_resolved_to_c_s3" class="item">Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>${foo[2]}</code> (where foo
represents the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for
element number 2 of the array named <code>@foo</code>, in which case please write
<code>$foo[2]</code>, or you might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to
the function named foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value it
returns.  If you meant that, write <code>${foo([2])}</code>.</p>
<p>In regular expressions, the <code>${foo[2]}</code> syntax is sometimes necessary
to disambiguate between array subscripts and character classes.
<code>/$length[2345]/</code>, for instance, will be interpreted as <code>$length</code>
followed by the character class <code>[2345]</code>. If an array subscript is what
you want, you can avoid the warning by changing <code>/${length[2345]}/</code>
to the unsightly <code>/${\$length[2345]}/</code>, by renaming your array to
something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword, or by
simply turning off warnings with <code>no warnings 'ambiguous';</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like <code>-foo</code>, which might be the
string <code>&quot;-foo&quot;</code>, or a call to the function <code>foo</code>, negated.  If you meant
the string, just write <code>&quot;-foo&quot;</code>.  If you meant the function call,
write <code>-foo()</code>.</p>
</dd>

In Perl 5.16, it will be resolved the other way</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W deprecated, ambiguous)  You wrote a pattern match with substitution
immediately followed by &quot;le&quot;.  In Perl 5.14 and earlier, this is
resolved as meaning to take the result of the substitution, and see if
it is stringwise less-than-or-equal-to what follows in the expression.
Having the &quot;le&quot; immediately following a pattern is deprecated behavior,
so in Perl 5.16, this expression will be resolved as meaning to do the
pattern match using the rules of the current locale, and evaluate the
rhs as an expression when doing the substitution.  In 5.14, if you want
the latter interpretation, you can simply write &quot;el&quot; instead.</p>

<dd>
<p>(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and
into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other,
though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script
which 'splits' output into two streams, such as</p>

<p>(W misc) The pattern match (<code>//</code>), substitution (<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#s_"><code>s///</code></a>), and
transliteration (<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr///</code></a>) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value (the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash) and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#grep">grep in the perlfunc manpage</a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#map">map in the perlfunc manpage</a> for
alternatives.</p>

<dd>
<p>(F) The argument to <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#exists"><code>exists()</code></a> for <code>exists &amp;sub</code> must be a subroutine

<p>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you
forgot the ) that closes the argument list.  (Layers take care of transforming
data between external and internal representations.)  Perl stopped parsing
the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push this layer.
If your program didn't explicitly request the failing operation, it may be
the result of the value of the environment variable PERLIO.</p>

<p>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments

<p>(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily the main
thread) exited while there were still other threads running.
Usually it's a good idea first to collect the return values of the
created threads by joining them, and only then to exit from the main
thread.  See <a href="../../lib/threads.html">the threads manpage</a>.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="attempt_to_bless_into_a_reference" class="item">Attempt to bless into a reference</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#bless"><code>bless()</code></a> operator is expected to be
the name of the package to bless the resulting object into. You've
supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote</p>

<p>(P internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="attempt_to_free_nonexistent_shared_string2" class="item">Attempt to free nonexistent shared string</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(P internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of

strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count
of a string that can no longer be found in the table.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>(W debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
<code>free_tmps()</code> routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
SV before the <code>free_tmps()</code> routine gets a chance, which means that the
<code>free_tmps()</code> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="attempt_to_free_unreferenced_glob_pointers" class="item">Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</a></strong></dt>

<p>(P internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="attempt_to_free_unreferenced_scalar" class="item">Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that <code>SvREFCNT_dec()</code> was called too many times, or
that <code>SvREFCNT_inc()</code> was called too few times, or that the SV was
mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
corrupted.</p>

<dd>
<p>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access-checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL <a href="#stat"><code>stat()</code></a> routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access-checking
routine knows about the Perl <a href="#stat"><code>stat</code></a> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>

example of the latter, the two constructs:</p>
<pre>
 $a =~ m/$foo/sand $bar
 $a =~ m/$foo/s and $bar</pre>

<dd>
<p>(F) <code>\N</code> has two meanings.</p>
<p>The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces,
meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
name. Thus <code>\N{ASTERISK}</code> is another way of writing <code>*</code>, valid in both
double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns.  In patterns,
it doesn't have the meaning an unescaped <code>*</code> does.</p>
<p>Starting in Perl 5.12.0, <code>\N</code> also can have an additional meaning (only)
in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.  (This is short
for <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#n"><code>[^\n]</code></a>, and like <code>.</code> but is not affected by the <a href="#s"><code>/s</code></a> regex modifier.)</p>
<p>This can lead to some ambiguities.  When <code>\N</code> is not followed immediately
by a left brace, Perl assumes the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#n"><code>[^\n]</code></a> meaning.  Also, if the braces
form a valid quantifier such as <code>\N{3}</code> or <code>\N{5,}</code>, Perl assumes that this
means to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples,
3; and 5 or more, respectively).  In all other case, where there is a
<code>\N{</code> and a matching <code>}</code>, Perl assumes that a character name is desired.</p>
<p>However, if there is no matching <code>}</code>, Perl doesn't know if it was
mistakenly omitted, or if <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#n"><code>[^\n]{</code></a> was desired, and raises this error.
If you meant the former, add the right brace; if you meant the latter,
escape the brace with a backslash, like so: <code>\N\{</code></p>

<p>One possible cause for this is that you expected to have imported a
constant to your name space with <strong>use</strong> or <strong>import</strong> while no such
importing took place, it may for example be that your operating system
does not support that particular constant. Hopefully you did use an

would probably have caught this error earlier it naturally does not
remedy the fact that your operating system still does not support that
constant. Maybe you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import
list of <strong>use</strong> or <strong>import</strong> or in the constant name at the line where

dead serious, fortunately: there is a &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot; that

match (<a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#p"><code>\p</code></a> or <code>\P</code>), but the regular expression is also being told to

class, which should know about the locale's rules.

<p>Even if the run-time locale is ISO 8859-1 (Latin1), which is a subset of
Unicode, some properties will give results that are not valid for that
subset.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples to help you see what's going on.  If the
locale is ISO 8859-7, the character at code point 0xD7 is the &quot;GREEK
CAPITAL LETTER CHI&quot;.  But in Unicode that code point means the
&quot;MULTIPLICATION SIGN&quot; instead, and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#p"><code>\p</code></a> always uses the Unicode
meaning.  That means that <code>\p{Alpha}</code> won't match, but <code>[[:alpha:]]</code>
should.  Only in the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same
positions as they are in Unicode.  But, even here, some properties give
incorrect results.  An example is <code>\p{Changes_When_Uppercased}</code> which
is true for &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS&quot;, but since the upper
case of that character is not in Latin1, in that locale it doesn't
change when upper cased.</p>

<p>(A) This is the error message generally seen in a browser window when trying
to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web. The actual error text
varies widely from server to server. The most frequently-seen variants
are &quot;500 Server error&quot;, &quot;Method (something) not permitted&quot;, &quot;Document
contains no data&quot;, &quot;Premature end of script headers&quot;, and &quot;Did not
produce a valid header&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error</strong>.</p>
<p>You need to make sure your script is executable, is accessible by the
user CGI is running the script under (which is probably not the user
account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment variables
(like PATH) from the user it isn't running under, and isn't in a
location where the CGI server can't find it, basically, more or less.

before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon

if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20

<p>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does

often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl
to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd
get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said</p>

<p>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list

</pre>
<p>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See

<p>You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated over.

<dt><strong>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <code>AUTOLOAD</code>
subroutines are looked up as methods (using the <code>@ISA</code> hierarchy)
even when the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain
functions (e.g. <code>Foo::bar()</code>), not as methods (e.g. <code>Foo-&gt;bar()</code> or
<code>$obj-&gt;bar()</code>).</p>
<p>This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' <code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<code>AUTOLOAD</code>s.</p>
<p>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <code>AUTOLOAD</code> for non-methods from a base class
named <code>BaseClass</code>, execute <code>*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</code> during
startup.</p>
<p>In code that currently says <a href="#qw"><code>use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);</code></a>
you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change <code>use AutoLoader;</code> to
<code>use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';</code>.</p>

<p>This is a long-standing bug that will be removed in Perl 5.16, as

<a href="#qw"><code>qw(...)</code></a> literals were always enclosed in parentheses, and as a result
you could sometimes omit parentheses around them.  (You could never do
the <a href="#qw"><code>foreach qw(a b c) {...}</code></a> that you might have expected, though.)

displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear literally in your

<p>(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the value of an

<dt><strong><a name="variable_s_is_not_available" class="item">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not available</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may be
declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
(Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
subs are created at run-time.) For example,</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> </span><span class="operator">{</span> <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$a</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> f </span><span class="operator">{</span> <span class="variable">$a</span> <span class="operator">}</span> <span class="operator">}</span>
</pre>
<p>At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current value of $a,
since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created yet. Conversely,
the following won't give a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by
now been created and is live:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> </span><span class="operator">{</span> <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$a</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="keyword">eval</span> <span class="string">'sub f { $a }'</span> <span class="operator">}-&gt;();</span>
</pre>
<p>The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> f </span><span class="operator">{</span>
        <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$a</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> </span><span class="operator">{</span> <span class="keyword">eval</span> <span class="string">'$a'</span> <span class="operator">}</span>
    <span class="operator">}</span>
    <span class="variable">f</span><span class="operator">()-&gt;();</span>
</pre>
<p>Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not currently being
executed, so its $a is not available for capture.</p>

<dd>
<p>(W misc) With &quot;use strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by

<dd>
<p>(W misc) A &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variable has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the
previous instance.  This is almost always a typographical error.  Note
that the earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope
or until all closure referents to it are destroyed.</p>

<dd>
<p>(W closure) An inner (nested) <em>named</em> subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>
<p>When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.</p>
<p>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <a href="#sub"><code>sub {}</code></a> syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are created, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>

<p>(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it wasn't expecting

way to quiet this warning is simply to add the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#utf8"><code>:utf8</code></a> layer to the
output, e.g. <code>binmode STDOUT, ':utf8'</code>.  Another way to turn off the
warning is to add <code>no warnings 'utf8';</code> but that is often closer to
cheating.  In general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the
filehandle with an encoding, see <a href="../../lib/open.html">the open manpage</a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#binmode">binmode in the perlfunc manpage</a>.</p>

<p>perl51310delta - what is new for perl v5.13.10</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This document describes differences between the 5.13.9 release and
the 5.13.10 release.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.13.8, first read
<a href="../../lib/pods/perl5139delta.html">the perl5139delta manpage</a>, which describes differences between 5.13.8 and
5.13.9.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="core_enhancements">Core Enhancements</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="the_new_regular_expression_modifiers_available_in_suffix_form">The new regular expression modifiers available in suffix form</a></h2>
<p>Various releases of the 5.13.x series have added new regular expression
modifiers, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#a"><code>/a</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#d"><code>/d</code></a>, <code>/l</code>, and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>/u</code></a>.  They were only available in
infix form (e.g., <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#a"><code>(?a:...)</code></a>) until this release; now they are usable
in suffix form.  This change was made too late to change all the
affected documentation, so there are a number of places that erroneously
say these must be used in infix form.</p>
<p>However, there is an ambiguity with the construct, <code>s/foo/bar/le...</code>.  Due
to backward compatibility constraints, in Perl 5.14 only, it will be
resolved as <code>s/foo/bar/ le...</code>, that is, as meaning to take the result
of the substitution, and see if it is stringwise less-than-or-equal-to
what follows. In Perl 5.16 and later, it will instead be resolved as
meaning to do the pattern match using the rules of the current locale,
and evaluate the rhs as an expression when doing the substitution.  In
5.14, if you want the latter interpretation, you can write &quot;el&quot; instead.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="add__p_titlecase__as_a_synonym_for__p_title_">Add <code>\p{Titlecase}</code> as a synonym for <code>\p{Title}</code></a></h2>
<p>This synonym is added for symmetry with the Unicode property names
<code>\p{Uppercase}</code> and <code>\p{Lowercase}</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="new_regular_expression_modifier_option__aa">New regular expression modifier option <code>/aa</code></a></h2>
<p>Doubling the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#a"><code>/a</code></a> regular expression modifier increases its effect,
so that in case-insensitive matching, no ASCII character will match a
non-ASCII character.  For example, normally,</p>
<pre>
    <span class="string">'k'</span> <span class="operator">=~</span> <span class="regex">/\N{KELVIN SIGN}/i</span>
</pre>
<p>will match; it won't under <code>/aa</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="new_warnings_categories_for_problematic__non__unicode_code_points_">New warnings categories for problematic (non-)Unicode code points.</a></h2>
<p>Three new warnings subcategories of &lt;utf8&gt; have been added.  These
allow you to turn off warnings for their covered events, while allowing
the other UTF-8 warnings to remain on.  The three categories are:
<code>surrogate</code> when UTF-16 surrogates are encountered;
<code>nonchar</code> when Unicode non-character code points are encountered;
and <code>non_unicode</code> when code points that are above the legal Unicode
maximum of 0x10FFFF are encountered.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="incompatible_changes">Incompatible Changes</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="most__p___properties_are_now_immune_from_case_insensitive_matching">Most <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#p"><code>\p{}</code></a> properties are now immune from case-insensitive matching</a></h2>
<p>For most Unicode properties, it doesn't make sense to have them match
differently under <code>/i</code> case-insensitive matching than not.  And doing
so leads to unexpected results and potential security holes.  For
example</p>
<pre>
 <span class="regex">m/\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}+/i</span>
</pre>
<p>could previously match non-ASCII characters because of the Unicode
matching rules.  There were a number of bugs in this feature until an
earlier release in the 5.13 series.  Now this release reverts, and
removes the feature completely except for the few properties where
people have come to expect it, namely the ones where casing is an
integral part of their functionality, such as <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#m_"><code>m/\p{Uppercase}/i</code></a> and
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#m_"><code>m/\p{Lowercase}/i</code></a>, both of which match the exact same code points,
namely those matched by <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#m_"><code>m/\p{Cased}/i</code></a>.  Details are in
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlrecharclass.html#unicode_properties">Unicode Properties in the perlrecharclass manpage</a>.</p>
<p>User-defined property handlers that need to match differently under
<code>/i</code> must change to read the new boolean parameter passed it which is
non-zero if case-insensitive matching is in effect; 0 if not.  See
<a href="../../lib/pods/perluniprops.html#user_defined_character_properties">User-Defined Character Properties in the perluniprops manpage</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="regex___p___in_pattern_implies_unicode_semantics">regex: \p{} in pattern implies Unicode semantics</a></h2>
<p>Now, a Unicode property match specified in the pattern will indicate
that the pattern is meant for matching according to Unicode rules
(e40e74f)</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="add_gvcv_set___and_gvgp_set___macros_and_change_gvgp__">add <code>GvCV_set()</code> and <code>GvGP_set()</code> macros and change <code>GvGP()</code></a></h2>
<p>This allows a future commit to eliminate some backref magic between GV
and CVs, which will require complete control over assignment to the
gp_cv slot.</p>
<p>If you've been using <code>GvGP()</code> in lvalue context this change will break
your code, you should use <code>GvGP_set()</code> instead. (c43ae56)</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_swash_inversion_hash_is_no_longer_exported_as_part_of_the_api">_swash_inversion_hash is no longer exported as part of the API</a></h2>
<p>This function shouldn't be called from XS code. (4c2e113)</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="unreferenced_objects_in_global_destruction">Unreferenced objects in global destruction</a></h2>
<p>The fix for [perl #36347], which made sure that destructors were called on
unreferenced objects, broke the tests for three CPAN modules, which
apparently rely on the bug.</p>
<p>To provide more time for fixing them (as this is such a minor bug), we
have reverted the fix until after perl 5.14.0.</p>
<p>This resolves [perl #82542] and other related tickets.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="close_on_shared_pipes"><a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#close"><code>close</code></a> on shared pipes</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#close"><code>close</code></a> function no longer waits for the child process to exit if the
underlying file descriptor is still in use by another thread, to avoid
deadlocks. It returns true in such cases.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="deprecated_modules2" class="item">Deprecated Modules</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and should be installed from CPAN instead. Distributions
on CPAN which require these should add them to their prerequisites. The
core versions of these modules warnings will issue a deprecation warning.</p>
<p>If you ship a packaged version of Perl, either alone or as part of a
larger system, then you should carefully consider the repercussions of
core module deprecations. You may want to consider shipping your default
build of Perl with packages for some or all deprecated modules which
install into <code>vendor</code> or <code>site</code> perl library directories. This will
inhibit the deprecation warnings.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may want to consider patching <em class="file">lib/deprecate.pm</em>
to provide deprecation warnings specific to your packaging system
or distribution of Perl, consistent with how your packaging system
or distribution manages a staged transition from a release where the
installation of a single package provides the given functionality, to
a later release where the system administrator needs to know to install
multiple packages to get that same functionality.</p>
<p>You can silence these deprecation warnings by installing the modules
in question from CPAN.  To install the latest version of all of them,
just install <code>Task::Deprecations::5_14</code>.</p>

<h2><a name="user_defined_case_mapping">User-defined case-mapping</a></h2>
<p>This feature is being deprecated due to its many issues, as documented in
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlunicode.html#user_defined_case_mappings__for_serious_hackers_only_">User-Defined Case Mappings (for serious hackers only) in the perlunicode manpage</a>.
It is planned to remove this feature in Perl 5.16.  A CPAN module
providing improved functionality is being prepared for release by the
time 5.14 is.</p>

<h2><a name="new_modules_and_pragmata">New Modules and Pragmata</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>CPAN::Meta</code> version 2.110440 has been added as a dual-life module. It
provides a standard library to read, interpret and write CPAN distribution
metadata files (e.g. META.json and META.yml) which describes a
distribution, its contents, and the requirements for building it and
installing it. The latest CPAN distribution metadata specification is
included as <code>CPAN::Meta::Spec</code> and notes on changes in the specification
over time are given in <code>CPAN::Meta::History</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Version::Requirements</code> version 0.101020 has been added as a dual-life
module.  It provides a standard library to model and manipulates module
prerequisites and version constraints as defined in the <a href="../../lib/CPAN/Meta/Spec.html">the CPAN::Meta::Spec manpage</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="updated_modules_and_pragmata">Updated Modules and Pragmata</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>B</code> has been upgraded from version 1.27 to 1.28.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Carp</code> has been upgraded from version 1.19 to 1.20.</p>
<p>[perl #82854] It now avoids using regular expressions that cause perl to
load its Unicode tables, in order to avoid the 'BEGIN not safe after
errors' error that will ensue if there has been a syntax error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CGI</code> has been upgraded from version 3.51 to 3.52</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CPAN</code> has been upgraded from version 1.94_64 to 1.94_65</p>
<p>Includes support for META.json and MYMETA.json.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CPANPLUS</code> has been upgraded from version 0.9011 to 0.9101</p>
<p>Includes support for META.json and MYMETA.json and a change to
using Digest::SHA for CPAN checksums.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>deprecate</code> has been upgraded from version 0.01 to 0.02.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>diagnostics</code> has been upgraded from version 1.21 to 1.22.</p>
<p>It now renders pod links slightly better, and has been taught to find
descriptions for messages that share their descriptions with other
messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#devel_dprof"><code>Devel::DProf</code></a> has been upgraded from version 20080331.00 to 20110217.00.</p>
<p>Merely loading <a href="#devel_dprof"><code>Devel::DProf</code></a> now no longer triggers profiling to start.
<code>use Devel::DProf</code> and <code>perl -d:DProf ...</code> still behave as before and start
the profiler.</p>
<p>NOTE: <a href="#devel_dprof"><code>Devel::DProf</code></a> is deprecated and will be removed from a future
version of Perl. We strongly recommend that you install and use
<a href="../../lib/Devel/NYTProf.html">the Devel::NYTProf manpage</a> instead, as it offers significantly improved
profiling and reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DynaLoader</code> has been upgraded from version 1.12 to 1.13.</p>
<p>[perl #84358] It no longer inherits from AutoLoader; hence it no longer
produces weird error messages for unsuccessful method calls on classes that
inherit from DynaLoader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>IO::Select</code> has been upgraded from version 1.17 to 1.18.</p>
<p>It now allows IO::Handle objects (and objects in derived classes) to be

closed or invalid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>IPC::Cmd</code> has been upgraded from version 0.68 to 0.70</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>HTTP::Tiny</code> has been upgraded from version 0.009 to 0.010</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Math::BigInt</code> has been upgraded from version 1.99_04 to 1.992.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Module::Build</code> has been upgraded from version 0.3607 to 0.37_05.</p>
<p>A notable change is the deprecation of several modules.
Module::Build::Version has been deprecated and Module::Build now relies
directly upon <a href="../../lib/version.html">the version manpage</a>.  Module::Build::ModuleInfo has been deprecated in
favor of a standalone copy of it called <a href="../../lib/Module/Metadata.html">the Module::Metadata manpage</a>.
Module::Build::YAML has been deprecated in favor of <a href="../../lib/CPAN/Meta/YAML.html">the CPAN::Meta::YAML manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Module::Build now also generates META.json and MYMETA.json files
in accordance with version 2 of the CPAN distribution metadata specification,
<a href="../../lib/CPAN/Meta/Spec.html">the CPAN::Meta::Spec manpage</a>.  The older format META.yml and MYMETA.yml files are
still generated, as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Module::Load::Conditional</code> has been upgraded from version 0.40 to 0.44</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Module::Metadata</code> has been upgraded from version 1.000003 to 1.000004.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>overload</code> has been upgraded from version 1.12 to 1.13.</p>
<p>The documentation has greatly improved. See <a href="#documentation">Documentation</a> below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Parse::CPAN::Meta</code> has been upgraded from version 1.40 to 1.4401.</p>
<p>The latest Parse::CPAN::Meta can now read YAML or JSON files using
<a href="../../lib/CPAN/Meta/YAML.html">the CPAN::Meta::YAML manpage</a> and <a href="../../lib/JSON/PP.html">the JSON::PP manpage</a>, which are now part of the Perl core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>re</code> has been upgraded from version 0.16 to 0.17.</p>
<p>It now supports the double-a flag: <code>use re '/aa';</code></p>
<p>The <code>regmust</code> function used to crash when called on a regular expression
belonging to a pluggable engine. Now it has been disabled for those.</p>
<p><code>regmust</code> no longer leaks memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Term::UI</code> has been upgraded from version 0.24 to 0.26</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Unicode::Collate</code> has been upgraded from version 0.68 to 0.72</p>
<p>This also sees the switch from using the pure-perl version of this
module to the XS version.`</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>VMS::DCLsym</code> has been upgraded from version 1.04 to 1.05.</p>
<p>Two bugs have been fixed [perl #84086]:</p>
<p>The symbol table name was lost when tying a hash, due to a thinko in
<code>TIEHASH</code>. The result was that all tied hashes interacted with the
local symbol table.</p>
<p>Unless a symbol table name had been explicitly specified in the call
to the constructor, querying the special key ':LOCAL' failed to
identify objects connected to the local symbol table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new function <code>Unicode::UCD::num()</code>.  This function will return the
numeric value of the string passed it; <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#undef"><code>undef</code></a> if the string in its
entirety has no safe numeric value.</p>
<p>To be safe, a string must be a single character which has a numeric
value, or consist entirely of characters that match \d, coming from the
same Unicode block of digits.  Thus, a mix of  Bengali and Western
digits would be considered unsafe, as well as a mix of half- and
full-width digits, but strings consisting entirely of Devanagari digits
or of &quot;Mathematical Bold&quot; digits would would be safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CPAN</code> has been upgraded from version 1.94_63 to 1.94_64.</p>
</li>

<h1><a name="internal_changes">Internal Changes</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix harmless invalid read in <code>Perl_re_compile()</code> (f6d9469)</p>
<p>[perl #2460] described a case where electric fence reported an invalid
read. This could be reproduced under valgrind with blead and -e'/x/',
but only on a non-debugging build.</p>
<p>This was because it was checking for certain pairs of nodes (e.g. BOL + END)
and wasn't allowing for EXACT nodes, which have the string at the next
node position when using a naive NEXTOPER(first). In the non-debugging
build, the nodes aren't initialised to zero, and a 1-char EXACT node isn't
long enough to spill into the type field of the &quot;next node&quot;.</p>
<p>Fix this by only using NEXTOPER(first) when we know the first node is
kosher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break out the generated function <code>Perl_keywords()</code> into <em class="file">keywords.c</em>, a new file. (26ea9e1)</p>
<p>As it and <code>Perl_yylex()</code> both need FEATURE_IS_ENABLED, <code>feature_is_enabled()</code> is
no longer static, and the two macro definitions move from toke.c to perl.h</p>
<p>Previously, one had to cut and paste the output of perl_keywords.pl into the
middle of toke.c, and it was not clear that it was generated code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of tests have been ported from Test to Test::More, e.g. in
3842ad6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase default PerlIO buffer size. (b83080d)</p>
<p>The previous default size of a PerlIO buffer (4096 bytes) has been increased
to the larger of 8192 bytes and your local BUFSIZ.  Benchmarks show that doubling
this decade-old default increases read and write performance in the neighborhood
of 25% to 50% when using the default layers of perlio on top of unix.  To choose
a non-default size, such as to get back the old value or to obtain and even
larger value, configure with:</p>
<pre>
     ./Configure -Accflags=-DPERLIOBUF_DEFAULT_BUFSIZ=N</pre>
<p>where N is the desired size in bytes; it should probably be a multiple of
your page size.</p>

<h1><a name="selected_bug_fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Unicode <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#p"><code>\p{}</code></a> property match in a regular expression pattern will
now force Unicode rules for the rest of the regular expression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[perl #38456] binmode FH, &quot;:crlf&quot; only modifies top crlf layer (7826b36)</p>
<p>When pushed on top of the stack, crlf will no longer enable crlf layers
lower in the stack. This will prevent unexpected results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix 'raw' layer for RT #80764 (ecfd064)</p>
<p>Made a ':raw' open do what it advertises to do (first open the file,
then binmode it), instead of leaving off the top layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use PerlIOBase_open for pop, utf8 and bytes layers (c0888ac)</p>
<p>Three of Perl's builtin PerlIO layers (<a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#pop"><code>:pop</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#utf8"><code>:utf8</code></a> and
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#bytes"><code>:bytes</code></a>) didn't allow stacking when opening a file. For example
this:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">open</span> <span class="variable">FH</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="string">'&gt;:pop:perlio'</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="string">'some.file'</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="keyword">die</span> <span class="variable">$!</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</pre>
<p>Would throw an error: &quot;Invalid argument&quot;. This has been fixed in this
release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An issue present since 5.13.1, where s/A/B/ with A utf8 and B
non-utf8, could cause corruption or segfaults has been
fixed. (c95ca9b)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>String evals will no longer fail after 2 billion scopes have been
compiled (d1bfb64, 2df5bdd, 0d311cd and 6012dc8)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[perl #81750] When strict 'refs' mode is off,
<code>%{...}</code> in rvalue context returns <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#undef"><code>undef</code></a> if
its argument is undefined. An optimisation introduced in perl 5.12.0 to
make <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#keys"><code>keys %{...}</code></a> faster when used as a boolean did not take this into
account, causing <code>keys %{+undef}</code> (and <code>keys %$foo</code> when <code>$foo</code> is
undefined) to be an error, which it should only be in strict mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[perl #83194] Combining the vector (%v) flag and dynamic precision would
cause sprintf to confuse the order of its arguments, making it treat the
string as the precision and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[perl #77692] Sometimes the UTF8 length cache would not be reset on a value
returned by substr, causing <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#length"><code>length(substr($uni_string,...))</code></a> to give
wrong answers. With <a href="../../lib/pods/perlvar.html#___utf8cache_"><code>${^UTF8CACHE}</code></a> set to -1, it would produce a 'panic'
error message, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the restoration of a localised typeglob on scope exit, any
destructors called as a result would be able to see the typeglob in an
inconsistent state, containing freed entries, which could result in a
crash. This would affect code like this:</p>
<pre>
  <span class="keyword">local</span> <span class="operator">*</span><span class="variable">@;</span>
  <span class="keyword">eval</span> <span class="operator">{</span> <span class="keyword">die</span> <span class="keyword">bless</span> <span class="operator">[]</span> <span class="operator">};</span> <span class="comment"># puts an object in $@</span>
  <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> DESTROY </span><span class="operator">{</span>
    <span class="keyword">local</span> <span class="variable">$@</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="comment"># boom</span>
  <span class="operator">}</span>
</pre>
<p>Now the glob entries are cleared before any destructors are called. This
also means that destructors can vivify entries in the glob. So perl tries
again and, if the entries are re-created too many times, dies with a
'panic: gp_free...' error message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[perl #78494] When pipes are shared between threads, the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#close"><code>close</code></a> function
(and any implicit close, such as on thread exit) no longer blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several contexts no longer allow a Unicode character to begin a word
that should never begin words, for an example an accent that must follow
another character previously could precede all other characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case insensitive matching in regular expressions compiled under <code>use
locale</code> now works much more sanely when the pattern and/or target string
are encoded in UTF-8.  Previously, under these conditions the localeness
was completely lost.  Now, code points above 255 are treated as Unicode,
but code points between 0 and 255 are treated using the current locale
rules, regardless of whether the pattern or string are encoded in UTF-8.
The few case insensitive matches that cross the 255/256 boundary are not
allowed.  For example, 0xFF does not caselessly match the character at
0x178, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS, because 0xFF may not be
LATIN SMALL LETTER Y in the current locale, and Perl has no way of
knowing if that character even exists in the locale, much less what code
point it is.</p>

<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>perl51311delta - what is new for perl v5.13.11</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This document describes differences between the 5.13.10 release and
the 5.13.11 release.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.13.9, first read
<a href="../../lib/pods/perl5139delta.html">the perl5139delta manpage</a>, which describes differences between 5.13.9 and
5.13.10.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="security">Security</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="user_defined_regular_expression_properties">User-defined regular expression properties</a></h2>
<p>Perl no longer allows a tainted regular expression to invoke a user-defined
property via <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#p"><code>\p{...}</code></a> syntax. It simply dies instead [perl #82616].</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="incompatible_changes">Incompatible Changes</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="local_____will_strip_all_magic_from___"><a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#local"><code>local($_)</code></a> will strip all magic from $_</a></h2>
<p><a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#local"><code>local()</code></a> on scalar variables will give them a new value, but keep all
their magic intact.  This has proven to be problematic for the default
scalar variable $_, where <a href="../../lib/pods/perlsub.html">the perlsub manpage</a> recommends that any subroutine
that assigns to $_ should localize it first.  This would throw an
exception if $_ is aliased to a read-only variable, and could have
various unintentional side-effects in general.</p>
<p>Therefore, as an exception to the general rule, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#local"><code>local($_)</code></a> will not
only assign a new value to $_, but also remove all existing magic from
it as well.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="passing_references_to_warn__">Passing references to <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#warn"><code>warn()</code></a></a></h2>
<p>An earlier Perl 5.13.x release changed <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#warn"><code>warn($ref)</code></a> to leave the reference
unchanged, allowing <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code> handlers to access the original
reference. But this stopped warnings that were references from having the
file and line number appended even when there was no <code>$SIG{__WARN__}</code>
handler in place.</p>
<p>Now <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#warn"><code>warn</code></a> checks for the presence of such a handler and, if there is
none, proceeds to stringify the reference and append the file and line
number. This allows simple uses of <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#warn"><code>warn</code></a> for debugging to continue to
work as they did before.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="fork___emulation_will_not_wait_for_signalled_children"><a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#fork"><code>fork()</code></a> emulation will not wait for signalled children</a></h2>
<p>On Windows parent processes would not terminate until all forked
childred had terminated first.  However, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#kill"><code>kill('KILL', ...)</code></a> is
inherently unstable on pseudo-processes, and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#kill"><code>kill('TERM', ...)</code></a>
might not get delivered if the child if blocked in a system call.</p>
<p>To avoid the deadlock and still provide a safe mechanism to terminate
the hosting process, Perl will now no longer wait for children that
have been sent a SIGTERM signal.  It is up to the parent process to
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#waitpid"><code>waitpid()</code></a> for these children if child clean-up processing must be
allowed to finish. However, it is also the responsibility of the
parent then to avoid the deadlock by making sure the child process
can't be blocked on I/O either.</p>
<p>See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfork.html">the perlfork manpage</a> for more information about the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#fork"><code>fork()</code></a> emulation on
Windows.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="perl_source_code_is_read_in_text_mode_on_windows">Perl source code is read in text mode on Windows</a></h2>
<p>Perl scripts used to be read in binary mode on Windows for the benefit
of the ByteLoader module (which is no longer part of core Perl).  This
had the side effect of breaking various operations on the DATA filehandle,
including seek()/tell(), and even simply reading from DATA after file handles
have been flushed by a call to <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#system"><code>system()</code></a>, backticks, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#fork"><code>fork()</code></a> etc.</p>
<p>The default build options for Windows have been changed to read Perl source
code on Windows in text mode now.  Hopefully ByteLoader will be updated on
CPAN to automatically handle this situation.</p>

<li>
<p>An earlier optimisation to speed up <code>my @array = ...</code> and

<hr />
<h1><a name="selected_bug_fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A fix for a bug in <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#length"><code>length(undef)</code></a> in 5.13.4 introduced a regression that
meant <code>print length undef</code> did not warn when warnings were enabled. It now
correctly warns [perl #85508].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>(?|...)</code> regular expression construct no longer crashes if the final
branch has more sets of capturing parentheses than any other branch. This
was fixed in Perl 5.10.1 for the case of a single branch, but that fix did
not take multiple branches into account [perl #84746].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessing an element of a package array with a hard-coded number (as
opposed to an arbitrary expression) would crash if the array did not exist.
Usually the array would be autovivified during compilation, but typeglob
manipulation could remove it, as in these two cases which used to crash:</p>
<pre>
  <span class="variable">*d</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="variable">*a</span><span class="operator">;</span>  <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="variable">$d</span><span class="operator">[</span><span class="number">0</span><span class="operator">]</span><span class="operator">;</span>
  <span class="keyword">undef</span> <span class="variable">*d</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="variable">$d</span><span class="operator">[</span><span class="number">0</span><span class="operator">]</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>#line</code> directives in string evals were not properly updating the arrays
of lines of code (<code>@{&quot;_&lt;...&quot;}</code>) that the debugger (or any debugging or
profiling module) uses. In threaded builds, they were not being updated at
all. In non-threaded builds, the line number was ignored, so any change to
the existing line number would cause the lines to be misnumbered
[perl #79442].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$AUTOLOAD</code> used to remain tainted forever if it ever became tainted. Now
it is correctly untainted if an autoloaded method is called and the method
name was not tainted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bug has been fixed in the implementation of <code>{...}</code> quantifiers in
regular expressions that prevented the code block in
<code>/((\w+)(?{ print $2 })){2}/</code> from seeing the <code>$2</code> sometimes
[perl #84294].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#sprintf"><code>sprintf</code></a> now dies when passed a tainted scalar for the format. It did
already die for arbitrary expressions, but not for simple scalars
[perl #82250].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DESTROY methods of objects implementing ties are no longer able to crash by
accessing the tied variable through a weak reference [perl #86328].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Windows, calling kill(9, $child) on a pseudo-process created by the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#fork"><code>fork()</code></a>
emulation is inherently unstable.  It can also be responsible for overriding
the parent process exit code with a value of '9' if the parent terminates
right after killing the child.  This condition will now happen a lot less
often than before.</p>
<p>See also <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#fork">fork() emulation will not wait for signalled children</a> for a
better way to terminate child processes that avoids deadlocks altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the <code>exists &amp;Errno::EFOO</code> idiom continues to work as documented.</p>
<p>A change post-5.12 caused the documented idiom not to work if Errno was loaded
after the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#exists"><code>exists</code></a> code had been compiled, as the compiler implicitly creates
typeglobs in the Errno symbol table when it builds the optree for the <code>exists
code</code>.</p>
</li>

to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of <code>perl -V</code>, will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org.">perl5-security-report@perl.org.</a> This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help

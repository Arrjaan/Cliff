<p>Unicode support is an extensive requirement. While Perl does not
implement the Unicode standard or the accompanying technical reports
from cover to cover, Perl does support many Unicode features.</p>
<p>People who want to learn to use Unicode in Perl, should probably read
the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlunitut.html">Perl Unicode tutorial, perlunitut</a> and
<a href="../../lib/pods/perluniintro.html">the perluniintro manpage</a>, before reading
this reference document.</p>
<p>Also, the use of Unicode may present security issues that aren't obvious.
Read <em>Unicode Security Considerations</em>.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="safest_if_you_use_feature_unicode_strings" class="item">Safest if you &quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>In order to preserve backward compatibility, Perl does not turn
on full internal Unicode support unless the pragma
<code>use feature 'unicode_strings'</code> is specified.  (This is automatically
selected if you use <code>use 5.012</code> or higher.)  Failure to do this can
trigger unexpected surprises.  See <a href="#the_unicode_bug">The &quot;Unicode Bug</a> below.</p>
<p>This pragma doesn't affect I/O, and there are still several places
where Unicode isn't fully supported, such as in filenames.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="input_and_output_layers" class="item">Input and Output Layers</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Perl knows when a filehandle uses Perl's internal Unicode encodings
(UTF-8, or UTF-EBCDIC if in EBCDIC) if the filehandle is opened with
the &quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; layer.  Other encodings can be converted to Perl's
encoding on input or from Perl's encoding on output by use of the
&quot;:encoding(...)&quot;  layer.  See <a href="../../lib/open.html">the open manpage</a>.</p>
<p>To indicate that Perl source itself is in UTF-8, use <code>use utf8;</code>.</p>

<dd>
<p>As a compatibility measure, the <code>use utf8</code> pragma must be explicitly
included to enable recognition of UTF-8 in the Perl scripts themselves
(in string or regular expression literals, or in identifier names) on
ASCII-based machines or to recognize UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC-based
machines.  <strong>These are the only times when an explicit <code>use utf8</code>
is needed.</strong>  See <a href="../../lib/utf8.html">the utf8 manpage</a>.</p>

<p>If a Perl script begins marked with the Unicode BOM (UTF-16LE, UTF16-BE,
or UTF-8), or if the script looks like non-BOM-marked UTF-16 of either

(BOMless UTF-8 cannot be effectively recognized or differentiated from
ISO 8859-1 or other eight-bit encodings.)</p>

<dd>
<p>By default, there is a fundamental asymmetry in Perl's Unicode model:
implicit upgrading from byte strings to Unicode strings assumes that
they were encoded in <em>ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)</em>, but Unicode strings are
downgraded with UTF-8 encoding.  This happens because the first 256
codepoints in Unicode happens to agree with Latin-1.</p>
<p>See <a href="#byte_and_character_semantics">Byte and Character Semantics</a> for more details.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="byte_and_character_semantics">Byte and Character Semantics</a></h2>
<p>Beginning with version 5.6, Perl uses logically-wide characters to
represent strings internally.</p>
<p>Starting in Perl 5.14, Perl-level operations work with
characters rather than bytes within the scope of a
<code>use feature 'unicode_strings'|feature</code> (or equivalently
<code>use 5.012</code> or higher).  (This is not true if bytes have been
explicitly requested by <code>use bytes|bytes</code>, nor necessarily true
for interactions with the platform's operating system.)</p>
<p>For earlier Perls, and when <code>unicode_strings</code> is not in effect, Perl
provides a fairly safe environment that can handle both types of
semantics in programs.  For operations where Perl can unambiguously
decide that the input data are characters, Perl switches to character
semantics.  For operations where this determination cannot be made
without additional information from the user, Perl decides in favor of
compatibility and chooses to use byte semantics.</p>
<p>When <code>use locale</code> is in effect (which overrides
<code>use feature 'unicode_strings'</code> in the same scope), Perl uses the
semantics associated
with the current locale.  Otherwise, Perl uses the platform's native
byte semantics for characters whose code points are less than 256, and
Unicode semantics for those greater than 255.  On EBCDIC platforms, this
is almost seamless, as the EBCDIC code pages that Perl handles are
equivalent to Unicode's first 256 code points.  (The exception is that
EBCDIC regular expression case-insensitive matching rules are not as
as robust as Unicode's.)   But on ASCII platforms, Perl uses US-ASCII
(or Basic Latin in Unicode terminology) byte semantics, meaning that characters
whose ordinal numbers are in the range 128 - 255 are undefined except for their
ordinal numbers.  This means that none have case (upper and lower), nor are any
a member of character classes, like <code>[:alpha:]</code> or <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\w</code></a>.  (But all do belong
to the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\W</code></a> class or the Perl regular expression extension <code>[:^alpha:]</code>.)</p>
<p>This behavior preserves compatibility with earlier versions of Perl,
which allowed byte semantics in Perl operations only if
none of the program's inputs were marked as being a source of Unicode
character data.  Such data may come from filehandles, from calls to
external programs, from information provided by the system (such as %ENV),
or from literals and constants in the source text.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#utf8"><code>utf8</code></a> pragma is primarily a compatibility device that enables
recognition of UTF-(8|EBCDIC) in literals encountered by the parser.
Note that this pragma is only required while Perl defaults to byte
semantics; when character semantics become the default, this pragma
may become a no-op.  See <a href="../../lib/utf8.html">the utf8 manpage</a>.</p>
<p>If strings operating under byte semantics and strings with Unicode
character data are concatenated, the new string will have
character semantics.  This can cause surprises: See <a href="#bugs">BUGS</a>, below.
You can choose to be warned when this happens.  See <a href="../../lib/encoding/warnings.html">the encoding::warnings manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Under character semantics, many operations that formerly operated on
bytes now operate on characters. A character in Perl is
logically just a number ranging from 0 to 2**31 or so. Larger
characters may encode into longer sequences of bytes internally, but
this internal detail is mostly hidden for Perl code.
See <a href="../../lib/pods/perluniintro.html">the perluniintro manpage</a> for more.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="effects_of_character_semantics">Effects of Character Semantics</a></h2>
<p>Character semantics have the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Strings--including hash keys--and regular expression patterns may
contain characters that have an ordinal value larger than 255.</p>
<p>If you use a Unicode editor to edit your program, Unicode characters may
occur directly within the literal strings in UTF-8 encoding, or UTF-16.
(The former requires a BOM or <code>use utf8</code>, the latter requires a BOM.)</p>
<p>Unicode characters can also be added to a string by using the <code>\N{U+...}</code>
notation.  The Unicode code for the desired character, in hexadecimal,
should be placed in the braces, after the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>U</code></a>. For instance, a smiley face is
<code>\N{U+263A}</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#x"><code>\x{...}</code></a> notation for characters 0x100 and
above.  For characters below 0x100 you may get byte semantics instead of
character semantics;  see <a href="#the_unicode_bug">The &quot;Unicode Bug</a>.  On EBCDIC machines there is
the additional problem that the value for such characters gives the EBCDIC
character rather than the Unicode one.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you</p>
<pre>
   <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">charnames</span> <span class="string">':full'</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</pre>
<p>you can use the <code>\N{...}</code> notation and put the official Unicode
character name within the braces, such as <code>\N{WHITE SMILING FACE}</code>.
See <a href="../../lib/charnames.html">the charnames manpage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an appropriate <a href="../../lib/encoding.html">the encoding manpage</a> is specified, identifiers within the
Perl script may contain Unicode alphanumeric characters, including
ideographs.  Perl does not currently attempt to canonicalize variable
names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular expressions match characters instead of bytes.  &quot;.&quot; matches
a character instead of a byte.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bracketed character classes in regular expressions match characters instead of
bytes and match against the character properties specified in the
Unicode properties database.  <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\w</code></a> can be used to match a Japanese
ideograph, for instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Named Unicode properties, scripts, and block ranges may be used (like bracketed
character classes) by using the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#p"><code>\p{}</code></a> &quot;matches property&quot; construct and
the <code>\P{}</code> negation, &quot;doesn't match property&quot;.
See <a href="#unicode_character_properties">Unicode Character Properties</a> for more details.</p>
<p>You can define your own character properties and use them
in the regular expression with the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#p"><code>\p{}</code></a> or <code>\P{}</code> construct.
See <a href="#user_defined_character_properties">User-Defined Character Properties</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The special pattern <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#x"><code>\X</code></a> matches a logical character, an &quot;extended grapheme
cluster&quot; in Standardese.  In Unicode what appears to the user to be a single
character, for example an accented <code>G</code>, may in fact be composed of a sequence
of characters, in this case a <code>G</code> followed by an accent character.  <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#x"><code>\X</code></a>
will match the entire sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr///</code></a> operator translates characters instead of bytes.  Note
that the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tr_"><code>tr///CU</code></a> functionality has been removed.  For similar
functionality see pack('U0', ...) and pack('C0', ...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case translation operators use the Unicode case translation tables
when character input is provided.  Note that <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#uc"><code>uc()</code></a>, or <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\U</code></a> in
interpolated strings, translates to uppercase, while <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ucfirst"><code>ucfirst</code></a>,
or <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\u</code></a> in interpolated strings, translates to titlecase in languages
that make the distinction (which is equivalent to uppercase in languages
without the distinction).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most operators that deal with positions or lengths in a string will
automatically switch to using character positions, including
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chop"><code>chop()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chomp"><code>chomp()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlvar.html#substr"><code>substr()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#pos"><code>pos()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#index"><code>index()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#rindex"><code>rindex()</code></a>,
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#sprintf"><code>sprintf()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#write"><code>write()</code></a>, and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#length"><code>length()</code></a>.  An operator that
specifically does not switch is <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#vec"><code>vec()</code></a>.  Operators that really don't
care include operators that treat strings as a bucket of bits such as
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#sort"><code>sort()</code></a>, and operators dealing with filenames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#pack"><code>pack()</code></a>/<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#unpack"><code>unpack()</code></a> letter <code>C</code> does <em>not</em> change, since it is often
used for byte-oriented formats.  Again, think <code>char</code> in the C language.</p>
<p>There is a new <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>U</code></a> specifier that converts between Unicode characters
and code points. There is also a <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>W</code></a> specifier that is the equivalent of
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chr"><code>chr</code></a>/<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ord"><code>ord</code></a> and properly handles character values even if they are above 255.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chr"><code>chr()</code></a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ord"><code>ord()</code></a> functions work on characters, similar to
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#pack"><code>pack(&quot;W&quot;)</code></a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#unpack"><code>unpack(&quot;W&quot;)</code></a>, <em>not</em> <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#pack"><code>pack(&quot;C&quot;)</code></a> and
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#unpack"><code>unpack(&quot;C&quot;)</code></a>.  <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#pack"><code>pack(&quot;C&quot;)</code></a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#unpack"><code>unpack(&quot;C&quot;)</code></a> are methods for
emulating byte-oriented <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chr"><code>chr()</code></a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ord"><code>ord()</code></a> on Unicode strings.
While these methods reveal the internal encoding of Unicode strings,
that is not something one normally needs to care about at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bit string operators, <code>&amp; | ^ ~</code>, can operate on character data.
However, for backward compatibility, such as when using bit string
operations when characters are all less than 256 in ordinal value, one
should not use <code>~</code> (the bit complement) with characters of both
values less than 256 and values greater than 256.  Most importantly,
DeMorgan's laws (<code>~($x|$y) eq ~$x&amp;~$y</code> and <code>~($x&amp;$y) eq ~$x|~$y</code>)
will not hold.  The reason for this mathematical <em>faux pas</em> is that
the complement cannot return <strong>both</strong> the 8-bit (byte-wide) bit
complement <strong>and</strong> the full character-wide bit complement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can define your own mappings to be used in <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lc"><code>lc()</code></a>,
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lcfirst"><code>lcfirst()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#uc"><code>uc()</code></a>, and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ucfirst"><code>ucfirst()</code></a> (or their double-quoted string inlined
versions such as <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\U</code></a>). See
<a href="#user_defined_case_mappings__for_serious_hackers_only_">User-Defined Case-Mappings</a>
for more details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>And finally, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#reverse"><code>scalar reverse()</code></a> reverses by character rather than by byte.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="unicode_character_properties">Unicode Character Properties</a></h2>
<p>(The only time that Perl considers a sequence of individual code
points as a single logical character is in the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#x"><code>\X</code></a> construct, already
mentioned above.   Therefore &quot;character&quot; in this discussion means a single
Unicode code point.)</p>
<p>Very nearly all Unicode character properties are accessible through
regular expressions by using the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#p"><code>\p{}</code></a> &quot;matches property&quot; construct
and the <code>\P{}</code> &quot;doesn't match property&quot; for its negation.</p>
<p>For instance, <code>\p{Uppercase}</code> matches any single character with the Unicode
&quot;Uppercase&quot; property, while <code>\p{L}</code> matches any character with a
General_Category of &quot;L&quot; (letter) property.  Brackets are not
required for single letter property names, so <code>\p{L}</code> is equivalent to <code>\pL</code>.</p>
<p>More formally, <code>\p{Uppercase}</code> matches any single character whose Unicode
Uppercase property value is True, and <code>\P{Uppercase}</code> matches any character
whose Uppercase property value is False, and they could have been written as
<code>\p{Uppercase=True}</code> and <code>\p{Uppercase=False}</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>This formality is needed when properties are not binary; that is, if they can
take on more values than just True and False.  For example, the Bidi_Class (see
<a href="#bidirectional_character_types">Bidirectional Character Types</a> below), can take on several different
values, such as Left, Right, Whitespace, and others.  To match these, one needs
to specify the property name (Bidi_Class), AND the value being matched against
(Left, Right, etc.).  This is done, as in the examples above, by having the
two components separated by an equal sign (or interchangeably, a colon), like
<code>\p{Bidi_Class: Left}</code>.</p>
<p>All Unicode-defined character properties may be written in these compound forms
of <code>\p{property=value}</code> or <code>\p{property:value}</code>, but Perl provides some
additional properties that are written only in the single form, as well as
single-form short-cuts for all binary properties and certain others described
below, in which you may omit the property name and the equals or colon
separator.</p>
<p>Most Unicode character properties have at least two synonyms (or aliases if you
prefer): a short one that is easier to type and a longer one that is more
descriptive and hence easier to understand.  Thus the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;Letter&quot; properties
above are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.  Likewise,
&quot;Upper&quot; is a synonym for &quot;Uppercase&quot;, and we could have written
<code>\p{Uppercase}</code> equivalently as <code>\p{Upper}</code>.  Also, there are typically
various synonyms for the values the property can be.   For binary properties,
&quot;True&quot; has 3 synonyms: &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot;; and &quot;False has correspondingly &quot;F&quot;,
&quot;No&quot;, and &quot;N&quot;.  But be careful.  A short form of a value for one property may
not mean the same thing as the same short form for another.  Thus, for the
General_Category property, &quot;L&quot; means &quot;Letter&quot;, but for the Bidi_Class property,
&quot;L&quot; means &quot;Left&quot;.  A complete list of properties and synonyms is in
<a href="../../lib/pods/perluniprops.html">the perluniprops manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Upper/lower case differences in property names and values are irrelevant;
thus <code>\p{Upper}</code> means the same thing as <code>\p{upper}</code> or even <code>\p{UpPeR}</code>.
Similarly, you can add or subtract underscores anywhere in the middle of a
word, so that these are also equivalent to <code>\p{U_p_p_e_r}</code>.  And white space
is irrelevant adjacent to non-word characters, such as the braces and the equals
or colon separators, so <code>\p{   Upper  }</code> and <code>\p{ Upper_case : Y }</code> are
equivalent to these as well.  In fact, white space and even
hyphens can usually be added or deleted anywhere.  So even <code>\p{ Up-per case = Yes}</code> is
equivalent.  All this is called &quot;loose-matching&quot; by Unicode.  The few places
where stricter matching is used is in the middle of numbers, and in the Perl
extension properties that begin or end with an underscore.  Stricter matching
cares about white space (except adjacent to non-word characters),
hyphens, and non-interior underscores.</p>
<p>You can also use negation in both <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#p"><code>\p{}</code></a> and <code>\P{}</code> by introducing a caret
(^) between the first brace and the property name: <code>\p{^Tamil}</code> is
equal to <code>\P{Tamil}</code>.</p>
<p>Almost all properties are immune to case-insensitive matching.  That is,
adding a <code>/i</code> regular expression modifier does not change what they
match.  There are two sets that are affected.
The first set is
<code>Uppercase_Letter</code>,
<code>Lowercase_Letter</code>,
and <code>Titlecase_Letter</code>,
all of which match <code>Cased_Letter</code> under <code>/i</code> matching.
And the second set is
<code>Uppercase</code>,
<code>Lowercase</code>,
and <code>Titlecase</code>,
all of which match <code>Cased</code> under <code>/i</code> matching.
This set also includes its subsets <code>PosixUpper</code> and <code>PosixLower</code> both
of which under <code>/i</code> matching match <code>PosixAlpha</code>.
(The difference between these sets is that some things, such as Roman
numerals, come in both upper and lower case so they are <code>Cased</code>, but aren't considered
letters, so they aren't <code>Cased_Letter</code>s.)</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="general_category"><strong>General_Category</strong></a></h3>
<p>Every Unicode character is assigned a general category, which is the &quot;most
usual categorization of a character&quot; (from
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44</a>).</p>
<p>The compound way of writing these is like <code>\p{General_Category=Number}</code>
(short, <code>\p{gc:n}</code>).  But Perl furnishes shortcuts in which everything up
through the equal or colon separator is omitted.  So you can instead just write
<code>\pN</code>.</p>
<p>Here are the short and long forms of the General Category properties:</p>
<pre>
    Short       Long</pre>

</p>
<h3><a name="scripts"><strong>Scripts</strong></a></h3>
<p>The world's languages are written in many different scripts.  This sentence
(unless you're reading it in translation) is written in Latin, while Russian is
written in Cyrillic, and Greek is written in, well, Greek; Japanese mainly in
Hiragana or Katakana.  There are many more.</p>
<p>The Unicode Script property gives what script a given character is in,
and the property can be specified with the compound form like
<code>\p{Script=Hebrew}</code> (short: <code>\p{sc=hebr}</code>).  Perl furnishes shortcuts for all
script names.  You can omit everything up through the equals (or colon), and
simply write <code>\p{Latin}</code> or <code>\P{Cyrillic}</code>.</p>
<p>A complete list of scripts and their shortcuts is in <a href="../../lib/pods/perluniprops.html">the perluniprops manpage</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="use_of_is_prefix"><strong>Use of &quot;Is&quot; Prefix</strong></a></h3>
<p>For backward compatibility (with Perl 5.6), all properties mentioned
so far may have <code>Is</code> or <code>Is_</code> prepended to their name, so <code>\P{Is_Lu}</code>, for
example, is equal to <code>\P{Lu}</code>, and <code>\p{IsScript:Arabic}</code> is equal to
<code>\p{Arabic}</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><a name="blocks"><strong>Blocks</strong></a></h3>
<p>In addition to <strong>scripts</strong>, Unicode also defines <strong>blocks</strong> of
characters.  The difference between scripts and blocks is that the
concept of scripts is closer to natural languages, while the concept
of blocks is more of an artificial grouping based on groups of Unicode
characters with consecutive ordinal values. For example, the &quot;Basic Latin&quot;
block is all characters whose ordinals are between 0 and 127, inclusive; in
other words, the ASCII characters.  The &quot;Latin&quot; script contains some letters
from this as well as several other blocks, like &quot;Latin-1 Supplement&quot;,
&quot;Latin Extended-A&quot;, etc., but it does not contain all the characters from
those blocks. It does not, for example, contain the digits 0-9, because
those digits are shared across many scripts. The digits 0-9 and similar groups,
like punctuation, are in the script called <code>Common</code>.  There is also a
script called <code>Inherited</code> for characters that modify other characters,
and inherit the script value of the controlling character.  (Note that
there are several different sets of digits in Unicode that are
equivalent to 0-9 and are matchable by <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#d"><code>\d</code></a> in a regular expression.
If they are used in a single language only, they are in that language's
script.  Only sets are used across several languages are in the
<code>Common</code> script.)</p>
<p>For more about scripts versus blocks, see UAX#24 &quot;Unicode Script Property&quot;:
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24</a></p>
<p>The Script property is likely to be the one you want to use when processing
natural language; the Block property may occasionally be useful in working
with the nuts and bolts of Unicode.</p>
<p>Block names are matched in the compound form, like <code>\p{Block: Arrows}</code> or
<code>\p{Blk=Hebrew}</code>.  Unlike most other properties, only a few block names have a
Unicode-defined short name.  But Perl does provide a (slight) shortcut:  You
can say, for example <code>\p{In_Arrows}</code> or <code>\p{In_Hebrew}</code>.  For backwards
compatibility, the <code>In</code> prefix may be omitted if there is no naming conflict
with a script or any other property, and you can even use an <code>Is</code> prefix
instead in those cases.  But it is not a good idea to do this, for a couple
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is confusing.  There are many naming conflicts, and you may forget some.
For example, <code>\p{Hebrew}</code> means the <em>script</em> Hebrew, and NOT the <em>block</em>
Hebrew.  But would you remember that 6 months from now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is unstable.  A new version of Unicode may pre-empt the current meaning by
creating a property with the same name.  There was a time in very early Unicode
releases when <code>\p{Hebrew}</code> would have matched the <em>block</em> Hebrew; now it
doesn't.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people prefer to always use <code>\p{Block: foo}</code> and <code>\p{Script: bar}</code>
instead of the shortcuts, whether for clarity, because they can't remember the
difference between 'In' and 'Is' anyway, or they aren't confident that those who
eventually will read their code will know that difference.</p>
<p>A complete list of blocks and their shortcuts is in <a href="../../lib/pods/perluniprops.html">the perluniprops manpage</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="other_properties"><strong>Other Properties</strong></a></h3>
<p>There are many more properties than the very basic ones described here.
A complete list is in <a href="../../lib/pods/perluniprops.html">the perluniprops manpage</a>.</p>
<p>Unicode defines all its properties in the compound form, so all single-form
properties are Perl extensions.  Most of these are just synonyms for the
Unicode ones, but some are genuine extensions, including several that are in
the compound form.  And quite a few of these are actually recommended by Unicode
(in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18</a>).</p>
<p>This section gives some details on all extensions that aren't synonyms for
compound-form Unicode properties (for those, you'll have to refer to the
<em>Unicode Standard</em>.</p>

<dt><strong><a name="p_decomposition_type_non_canonical_short_p_dt_noncanon" class="item"><strong><code>\p{Decomposition_Type: Non_Canonical}</code></strong>    (Short: <code>\p{Dt=NonCanon}</code>)</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Matches a character that has a non-canonical decomposition.</p>
<p>To understand the use of this rarely used property=value combination, it is
necessary to know some basics about decomposition.
Consider a character, say H.  It could appear with various marks around it,
such as an acute accent, or a circumflex, or various hooks, circles, arrows,
<em>etc.</em>, above, below, to one side or the other, etc.  There are many
possibilities among the world's languages.  The number of combinations is
astronomical, and if there were a character for each combination, it would
soon exhaust Unicode's more than a million possible characters.  So Unicode
took a different approach: there is a character for the base H, and a
character for each of the possible marks, and these can be variously combined
to get a final logical character.  So a logical character--what appears to be a
single character--can be a sequence of more than one individual characters.
This is called an &quot;extended grapheme cluster&quot;;  Perl furnishes the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#x"><code>\X</code></a>
regular expression construct to match such sequences.</p>
<p>But Unicode's intent is to unify the existing character set standards and
practices, and several pre-existing standards have single characters that
mean the same thing as some of these combinations.  An example is ISO-8859-1,
which has quite a few of these in the Latin-1 range, an example being &quot;LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER E WITH ACUTE&quot;.  Because this character was in this pre-existing
standard, Unicode added it to its repertoire.  But this character is considered
by Unicode to be equivalent to the sequence consisting of the character
&quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E&quot; followed by the character &quot;COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH ACUTE&quot; is called a &quot;pre-composed&quot; character, and
its equivalence with the sequence is called canonical equivalence.  All
pre-composed characters are said to have a decomposition (into the equivalent
sequence), and the decomposition type is also called canonical.</p>
<p>However, many more characters have a different type of decomposition, a
&quot;compatible&quot; or &quot;non-canonical&quot; decomposition.  The sequences that form these
decompositions are not considered canonically equivalent to the pre-composed
character.  An example, again in the Latin-1 range, is the &quot;SUPERSCRIPT ONE&quot;.
It is somewhat like a regular digit 1, but not exactly; its decomposition
into the digit 1 is called a &quot;compatible&quot; decomposition, specifically a
&quot;super&quot; decomposition.  There are several such compatibility
decompositions (see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44</a>), including one
called &quot;compat&quot;, which means some miscellaneous type of decomposition
that doesn't fit into the decomposition categories that Unicode has chosen.</p>
<p>Note that most Unicode characters don't have a decomposition, so their
decomposition type is &quot;None&quot;.</p>
<p>For your convenience, Perl has added the <code>Non_Canonical</code> decomposition
type to mean any of the several compatibility decompositions.</p>

<dd>
<p>This property is used when you need to know in what Unicode version(s) a
character is.</p>
<p>The &quot;*&quot; above stands for some two digit Unicode version number, such as
<code>1.1</code> or <code>4.0</code>; or the &quot;*&quot; can also be <code>Unassigned</code>.  This property will
match the code points whose final disposition has been settled as of the
Unicode release given by the version number; <code>\p{Present_In: Unassigned}</code>
will match those code points whose meaning has yet to be assigned.</p>
<p>For example, <code>U+0041</code> &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A&quot; was present in the very first
Unicode release available, which is <code>1.1</code>, so this property is true for all
valid &quot;*&quot; versions.  On the other hand, <code>U+1EFF</code> was not assigned until version
5.1 when it became &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH LOOP&quot;, so the only &quot;*&quot; that
would match it are 5.1, 5.2, and later.</p>
<p>Unicode furnishes the <code>Age</code> property from which this is derived.  The problem
with Age is that a strict interpretation of it (which Perl takes) has it
matching the precise release a code point's meaning is introduced in.  Thus
<code>U+0041</code> would match only 1.1; and <code>U+1EFF</code> only 5.1.  This is not usually what
you want.</p>
<p>Some non-Perl implementations of the Age property may change its meaning to be
the same as the Perl Present_In property; just be aware of that.</p>
<p>Another confusion with both these properties is that the definition is not
that the code point has been <em>assigned</em>, but that the meaning of the code point
has been <em>determined</em>.  This is because 66 code points will always be
unassigned, and so the Age for them is the Unicode version in which the decision
to make them so was made.  For example, <code>U+FDD0</code> is to be permanently
unassigned to a character, and the decision to do that was made in version 3.1,
so <code>\p{Age=3.1}</code> matches this character, as also does <code>\p{Present_In: 3.1}</code> and up.</p>

<p>Note that the effect is compile-time and immutable once defined.
However, the subroutines are passed a single parameter, which is 0 if
case-sensitive matching is in effect and non-zero if caseless matching
is in effect.  The subroutine may return different values depending on
the value of the flag, and one set of values will immutably be in effect
for all case-sensitive matches, and the other set for all case-insensitive
matches.</p>
<p>Note that if the regular expression is tainted, then Perl will die rather
than calling the subroutine, where the name of the subroutine is
determined by the tainted data.</p>
<p>The subroutines must return a specially-formatted string, with one
or more newline-separated lines.  Each line must be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A single hexadecimal number denoting a Unicode code point to include.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two hexadecimal numbers separated by horizontal whitespace (space or
tabular characters) denoting a range of Unicode code points to include.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something to include, prefixed by &quot;+&quot;: a built-in character
property (prefixed by &quot;utf8::&quot;) or a user-defined character property,
to represent all the characters in that property; two hexadecimal code
points for a range; or a single hexadecimal code point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something to exclude, prefixed by &quot;-&quot;: an existing character
property (prefixed by &quot;utf8::&quot;) or a user-defined character property,
to represent all the characters in that property; two hexadecimal code
points for a range; or a single hexadecimal code point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something to negate, prefixed &quot;!&quot;: an existing character
property (prefixed by &quot;utf8::&quot;) or a user-defined character property,
to represent all the characters in that property; two hexadecimal code

</li>
<li>
<p>Something to intersect with, prefixed by &quot;&amp;&quot;: an existing character

</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to define a property that covers both the Japanese
syllabaries (hiragana and katakana), you can define</p>

</pre>
<p>Imagine that the here-doc end marker is at the beginning of the line.
Now you can use <code>\p{InKana}</code> and <code>\P{InKana}</code>.</p>
<p>You could also have used the existing block property names:</p>

not the raw block ranges: in other words, you want to remove

<h2><a name="user_defined_case_mappings__for_serious_hackers_only_">User-Defined Case Mappings (for serious hackers only)</a></h2>
<p><strong>This featured is deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in Perl
5.16.</strong>
The CPAN module <a href="../../Unicode/Casing.html">the Unicode::Casing manpage</a> provides better functionality
without the drawbacks described below.</p>
<p>You can define your own mappings to be used in <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lc"><code>lc()</code></a>,
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lcfirst"><code>lcfirst()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#uc"><code>uc()</code></a>, and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ucfirst"><code>ucfirst()</code></a> (or their string-inlined versions,
<code>\L</code>, <code>\l</code>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\U</code></a>, and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\u</code></a>).  The mappings are currently only valid
on strings encoded in UTF-8, but see below for a partial workaround for
this restriction.</p>
<p>The principle is similar to that of user-defined character
properties: define subroutines that do the mappings.
<code>ToLower</code> is used for <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lc"><code>lc()</code></a>, <code>\L</code>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lcfirst"><code>lcfirst()</code></a>, and <code>\l</code>; <code>ToTitle</code> for
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ucfirst"><code>ucfirst()</code></a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\u</code></a>; and <code>ToUpper</code> for <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#uc"><code>uc()</code></a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\U</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>ToUpper()</code> should look something like this:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> ToUpper </span><span class="operator">{</span>
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="operator">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="default">END</span><span class="operator">;</span><span class="string">
    0061\t007A\t0041
    0101\t\t0100
    </span><span class="default">END</span>
    <span class="operator">}</span>
</pre>
<p>This sample <code>ToUpper()</code> has the effect of mapping &quot;a-z&quot; to &quot;A-Z&quot;, 0x101
to 0x100, and all other characters map to themselves.  The first
returned line means to map the code point at 0x61 (&quot;a&quot;) to 0x41 (&quot;A&quot;),
the code point at 0x62 (&quot;b&quot;) to 0x42 (&quot;B&quot;),  ..., 0x7A (&quot;z&quot;) to 0x5A
(&quot;Z&quot;).  The second line maps just the code point 0x101 to 0x100.  Since
there are no other mappings defined, all other code points map to
themselves.</p>
<p>This mechanism is not well behaved as far as affecting other packages
and scopes.  All non-threaded programs have exactly one uppercasing
behavior, one lowercasing behavior, and one titlecasing behavior in
effect for utf8-encoded strings for the duration of the program.  Each
of these behaviors is irrevocably determined the first time the
corresponding function is called to change a utf8-encoded string's case.
If a corresponding <code>To-</code> function has been defined in the package that
makes that first call, the mapping defined by that function will be the
mapping used for the duration of the program's execution across all
packages and scopes.  If no corresponding <code>To-</code> function has been
defined in that package, the standard official mapping will be used for
all packages and scopes, and any corresponding <code>To-</code> function anywhere
will be ignored.  Threaded programs have similar behavior.  If the
program's casing behavior has been decided at the time of a thread's
creation, the thread will inherit that behavior.  But, if the behavior
hasn't been decided, the thread gets to decide for itself, and its
decision does not affect other threads nor its creator.</p>
<p>As shown by the example above, you have to furnish a complete mapping;
you can't just override a couple of characters and leave the rest
unchanged.  You can find all the official mappings in the directory
<code>$Config{privlib}</code><em class="file">/unicore/To/</em>.  The mapping data is returned as the
here-document.  The <code>utf8::ToSpecFoo</code> hashes in those files are special
exception mappings derived from
<code>$Config{privlib}</code><em class="file">/unicore/SpecialCasing.txt</em>.  (The &quot;Digit&quot; and
&quot;Fold&quot; mappings that one can see in the directory are not directly
user-accessible, one can use either the <a href="../../lib/Unicode/UCD.html">the Unicode::UCD manpage</a> module, or just match
case-insensitively, which is what uses the &quot;Fold&quot; mapping.  Neither are user
overridable.)</p>
<p>If you have many mappings to change, you can take the official mapping data,
change by hand the affected code points, and place the whole thing into your
subroutine.  But this will only be valid on Perls that use the same Unicode
version.  Another option would be to have your subroutine read the official
mapping files and overwrite the affected code points.</p>
<p>If you have only a few mappings to change, starting in 5.14 you can use the
following trick, here illustrated for Turkish.</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">Config</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">charnames</span> <span class="string">":full"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</pre>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> ToUpper </span><span class="operator">{</span>
        <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$official</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="string">"</span><span class="variable">$Config</span><span class="string">{privlib}/unicore/To/Upper.pl"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="variable">$utf8::ToSpecUpper</span><span class="operator">{</span><span class="string">'i'</span><span class="operator">}</span> <span class="operator">=</span>
                           <span class="string">"\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE}"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="variable">$official</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="operator">}</span>
</pre>
<p>This takes the official mappings and overrides just one, for &quot;LATIN SMALL
LETTER I&quot;.  The keys to the hash must be the bytes that form the UTF-8
(on EBCDIC platforms, UTF-EBCDIC) of the character, as illustrated by
the inverse function.</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> ToLower </span><span class="operator">{</span>
        <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$official</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="variable">$lower</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="variable">$utf8::ToSpecLower</span><span class="operator">{</span><span class="string">"\xc4\xb0"</span><span class="operator">}</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">"i"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="variable">$official</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="operator">}</span>
</pre>
<p>This example is for an ASCII platform, and <code>\xc4\xb0</code> is the string of
bytes that together form the UTF-8 that represents <code>\N{LATIN CAPITAL
LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE}</code>, <code>U+0130</code>.  You can avoid having to figure out
these bytes, and at the same time make it work on all platforms by
instead writing:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> ToLower </span><span class="operator">{</span>
        <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$official</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="variable">$lower</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$sequence</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">"\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE}"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="variable">utf8::encode</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$sequence</span><span class="operator">);</span>
        <span class="variable">$utf8::ToSpecLower</span><span class="operator">{</span><span class="variable">$sequence</span><span class="operator">}</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">"i"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="variable">$official</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="operator">}</span>
</pre>
<p>This works because <code>utf8::encode()</code> takes the single character and
converts it to the sequence of bytes that constitute it.  Note that we took
advantage of the fact that <code>&quot;i&quot;</code> is the same in UTF-8 or UTF_EBCIDIC as not;
otherwise we would have had to write</p>
<pre>
        <span class="variable">$utf8::ToSpecLower</span><span class="operator">{</span><span class="variable">$sequence</span><span class="operator">}</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">"\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER I}"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</pre>
<p>in the ToLower example, and in the ToUpper example, use</p>
<pre>
        <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$sequence</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">"\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER I}"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="variable">utf8::encode</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$sequence</span><span class="operator">);</span>
</pre>
<p>A big caveat to the above trick and to this whole mechanism in general,
is that they work only on strings encoded in UTF-8.  You can partially
get around this by using <code>use subs</code>.  (But better to just convert to
use <a href="../../Unicode/Casing.html">the Unicode::Casing manpage</a>.)  For example:
(The trick illustrated here does work in earlier releases, but only if all the
characters you want to override have ordinal values of 256 or higher, or
if you use the other tricks given just below.)</p>
<p>The mappings are in effect only for the package they are defined in, and only
on scalars that have been marked as having Unicode characters, for example by
using <code>utf8::upgrade()</code>.  Although probably not advisable, you can
cause the mappings to be used globally by importing into <code>CORE::GLOBAL</code>
(see <a href="../../lib/CORE.html">the CORE manpage</a>).</p>
<p>You can partially get around the restriction that the source strings
must be in utf8 by using <code>use subs</code> (or by importing into <code>CORE::GLOBAL</code>) by:</p>

<p>These examples (also for Turkish) make sure the input is in UTF-8, and then
call the corresponding official function, which will use the <code>ToUpper()</code> and
<code>ToLower()</code> functions you have defined.
(For Turkish, there are other required functions: <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ucfirst"><code>ucfirst</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lcfirst"><code>lcfirst</code></a>,
and <code>ToTitle</code>. These are very similar to the ones given above.)</p>
<p>The reason this is only a partial fix is that it doesn't affect the <code>\l</code>,
<code>\L</code>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\u</code></a>, and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\U</code></a> case-change operations in regular expressions,
which still require the source to be encoded in utf8 (see <a href="#the_unicode_bug">The &quot;Unicode Bug</a>). (Again, use <a href="../../Unicode/Casing.html">the Unicode::Casing manpage</a> instead.)</p>
<p>The <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lc"><code>lc()</code></a> example shows how you can add context-dependent casing. Note
that context-dependent casing suffers from the problem that the string
passed to the casing function may not have sufficient context to make
the proper choice. Also, it will not be called for <code>\l</code>, <code>\L</code>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\u</code></a>,
and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\U</code></a>.</p>

<h2><a name="unicode_encodings">Unicode Encodings</a></h2>
<p>Unicode characters are assigned to <em>code points</em>, which are abstract
numbers.  To use these numbers, various encodings are needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UTF-8</p>
<p>UTF-8 is a variable-length (1 to 4 bytes), byte-order independent
encoding. For ASCII (and we really do mean 7-bit ASCII, not another
8-bit encoding), UTF-8 is transparent.</p>
<p>The following table is from Unicode 3.2.</p>
<pre>
 Code Points            1st Byte  2nd Byte  3rd Byte  4th Byte</pre>
<pre>
   U+0000..U+007F       00..7F
   U+0080..U+07FF     * C2..DF    80..BF
   U+0800..U+0FFF       E0      * A0..BF    80..BF
   U+1000..U+CFFF       E1..EC    80..BF    80..BF
   U+D000..U+D7FF       ED        80..9F    80..BF
   U+D800..U+DFFF       +++++++ utf16 surrogates, not legal utf8 +++++++
   U+E000..U+FFFF       EE..EF    80..BF    80..BF
  U+10000..U+3FFFF      F0      * 90..BF    80..BF    80..BF
  U+40000..U+FFFFF      F1..F3    80..BF    80..BF    80..BF
 U+100000..U+10FFFF     F4        80..8F    80..BF    80..BF</pre>
<p>Note the gaps marked by &quot;*&quot; before several of the byte entries above.  These are
caused by legal UTF-8 avoiding non-shortest encodings: it is technically
possible to UTF-8-encode a single code point in different ways, but that is
explicitly forbidden, and the shortest possible encoding should always be used
(and that is what Perl does).</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is via bits:</p>
<pre>
 Code Points                    1st Byte   2nd Byte  3rd Byte  4th Byte</pre>
<pre>
                    0aaaaaaa     0aaaaaaa
            00000bbbbbaaaaaa     110bbbbb  10aaaaaa
            ccccbbbbbbaaaaaa     1110cccc  10bbbbbb  10aaaaaa
  00000dddccccccbbbbbbaaaaaa     11110ddd  10cccccc  10bbbbbb  10aaaaaa</pre>
<p>As you can see, the continuation bytes all begin with &quot;10&quot;, and the
leading bits of the start byte tell how many bytes there are in the
encoded character.</p>
<p>The original UTF-8 specification allowed up to 6 bytes, to allow
encoding of numbers up to 0x7FFF_FFFF.  Perl continues to allow those,
and has extended that up to 13 bytes to encode code points up to what
can fit in a 64-bit word.  However, Perl will warn if you output any of
these as being non-portable; and under strict UTF-8 input protocols,
they are forbidden.</p>
<p>The Unicode non-character code points are also disallowed in UTF-8 in
&quot;open interchange&quot;.  See <a href="#non_character_code_points">Non-character code points</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTF-EBCDIC</p>
<p>Like UTF-8 but EBCDIC-safe, in the way that UTF-8 is ASCII-safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, Surrogates, and BOMs (Byte Order Marks)</p>
<p>The followings items are mostly for reference and general Unicode
knowledge, Perl doesn't use these constructs internally.</p>
<p>Like UTF-8, UTF-16 is a variable-width encoding, but where
UTF-8 uses 8-bit code units, UTF-16 uses 16-bit code units.
All code points occupy either 2 or 4 bytes in UTF-16: code points
<code>U+0000..U+FFFF</code> are stored in a single 16-bit unit, and code
points <code>U+10000..U+10FFFF</code> in two 16-bit units.  The latter case is
using <em>surrogates</em>, the first 16-bit unit being the <em>high
surrogate</em>, and the second being the <em>low surrogate</em>.</p>
<p>Surrogates are code points set aside to encode the <code>U+10000..U+10FFFF</code>
range of Unicode code points in pairs of 16-bit units.  The <em>high
surrogates</em> are the range <code>U+D800..U+DBFF</code> and the <em>low surrogates</em>
are the range <code>U+DC00..U+DFFF</code>.  The surrogate encoding is</p>

</pre>
<p>and the decoding is</p>
<pre>
    <span class="variable">$uni</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="number">0x10000</span> <span class="operator">+</span> <span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$hi</span> <span class="operator">-</span> <span class="number">0xD800</span><span class="operator">)</span> <span class="operator">*</span> <span class="number">0x400</span> <span class="operator">+</span> <span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$lo</span> <span class="operator">-</span> <span class="number">0xDC00</span><span class="operator">);</span>
</pre>
<p>Because of the 16-bitness, UTF-16 is byte-order dependent.  UTF-16
itself can be used for in-memory computations, but if storage or
transfer is required either UTF-16BE (big-endian) or UTF-16LE
(little-endian) encodings must be chosen.</p>
<p>This introduces another problem: what if you just know that your data
is UTF-16, but you don't know which endianness?  Byte Order Marks, or
BOMs, are a solution to this.  A special character has been reserved
in Unicode to function as a byte order marker: the character with the
code point <code>U+FEFF</code> is the BOM.</p>
<p>The trick is that if you read a BOM, you will know the byte order,
since if it was written on a big-endian platform, you will read the
bytes <code>0xFE 0xFF</code>, but if it was written on a little-endian platform,
you will read the bytes <code>0xFF 0xFE</code>.  (And if the originating platform
was writing in UTF-8, you will read the bytes <code>0xEF 0xBB 0xBF</code>.)</p>
<p>The way this trick works is that the character with the code point
<code>U+FFFE</code> is not supposed to be in input streams, so the
sequence of bytes <code>0xFF 0xFE</code> is unambiguously &quot;BOM, represented in
little-endian format&quot; and cannot be <code>U+FFFE</code>, represented in big-endian
format&quot;.</p>
<p>Surrogates have no meaning in Unicode outside their use in pairs to
represent other code points.  However, Perl allows them to be
represented individually internally, for example by saying
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chr"><code>chr(0xD801)</code></a>, so that all code points, not just those valid for open
interchange, are
representable.  Unicode does define semantics for them, such as their
General Category is &quot;Cs&quot;.  But because their use is somewhat dangerous,
Perl will warn (using the warning category &quot;surrogate&quot;, which is a
sub-category of &quot;utf8&quot;) if an attempt is made
to do things like take the lower case of one, or match
case-insensitively, or to output them.  (But don't try this on Perls
before 5.14.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTF-32, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE</p>
<p>The UTF-32 family is pretty much like the UTF-16 family, expect that
the units are 32-bit, and therefore the surrogate scheme is not
needed.  UTF-32 is a fixed-width encoding.  The BOM signatures are
<code>0x00 0x00 0xFE 0xFF</code> for BE and <code>0xFF 0xFE 0x00 0x00</code> for LE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UCS-2, UCS-4</p>
<p>Legacy, fixed-width encodings defined by the ISO 10646 standard.  UCS-2 is a 16-bit
encoding.  Unlike UTF-16, UCS-2 is not extensible beyond <code>U+FFFF</code>,
because it does not use surrogates.  UCS-4 is a 32-bit encoding,
functionally identical to UTF-32 (the difference being that
UCS-4 forbids neither surrogates nor code points larger than 0x10_FFFF).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTF-7</p>
<p>A seven-bit safe (non-eight-bit) encoding, which is useful if the
transport or storage is not eight-bit safe.  Defined by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2152.txt" class="rfc">RFC 2152</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="non_character_code_points">Non-character code points</a></h2>
<p>66 code points are set aside in Unicode as &quot;non-character code points&quot;.
These all have the Unassigned (Cn) General Category, and they never will
be assigned.  These are never supposed to be in legal Unicode input
streams, so that code can use them as sentinels that can be mixed in
with character data, and they always will be distinguishable from that data.
To keep them out of Perl input streams, strict UTF-8 should be
specified, such as by using the layer <code>:encoding('UTF-8')</code>.  The
non-character code points are the 32 between U+FDD0 and U+FDEF, and the
34 code points U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, ... U+10FFFE, U+10FFFF.
Some people are under the mistaken impression that these are &quot;illegal&quot;,
but that is not true.  An application or cooperating set of applications
can legally use them at will internally; but these code points are
&quot;illegal for open interchange&quot;.  Therefore, Perl will not accept these
from input streams unless lax rules are being used, and will warn
(using the warning category &quot;nonchar&quot;, which is a sub-category of &quot;utf8&quot;) if
an attempt is made to output them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="beyond_unicode_code_points">Beyond Unicode code points</a></h2>
<p>The maximum Unicode code point is U+10FFFF.  But Perl accepts code
points up to the maximum permissible unsigned number available on the
platform.  However, Perl will not accept these from input streams unless
lax rules are being used, and will warn (using the warning category
&quot;non_unicode&quot;, which is a sub-category of &quot;utf8&quot;) if an attempt is made to
operate on or output them.  For example, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#uc"><code>uc(0x11_0000)</code></a> will generate
this warning, returning the input parameter as its result, as the upper
case of every non-Unicode code point is the code point itself.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="security_implications_of_unicode">Security Implications of Unicode</a></h2>
<p>Read <em>Unicode Security Considerations</em>.
Also, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Malformed UTF-8</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the original specification of UTF-8 leaves some room for
interpretation of how many bytes of encoded output one should generate
from one input Unicode character.  Strictly speaking, the shortest
possible sequence of UTF-8 bytes should be generated,
because otherwise there is potential for an input buffer overflow at
the receiving end of a UTF-8 connection.  Perl always generates the
shortest length UTF-8, and with warnings on, Perl will warn about
non-shortest length UTF-8 along with other malformations, such as the
surrogates, which are not Unicode code points valid for interchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular expression pattern matching may surprise you if you're not
accustomed to Unicode.  Starting in Perl 5.14, several pattern
modifiers are available to control this, called the character set
modifiers.  Details are given in <a href="../../lib/pods/perlre.html#character_set_modifiers">Character set modifiers in the perlre manpage</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As discussed elsewhere, Perl has one foot (two hooves?) planted in
each of two worlds: the old world of bytes and the new world of
characters, upgrading from bytes to characters when necessary.
If your legacy code does not explicitly use Unicode, no automatic
switch-over to characters should happen.  Characters shouldn't get
downgraded to bytes, either.  It is possible to accidentally mix bytes
and characters, however (see <a href="../../lib/pods/perluniintro.html">the perluniintro manpage</a>), in which case <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\w</code></a> in
regular expressions might start behaving differently (unless the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#a"><code>/a</code></a>
modifier is in effect).  Review your code.  Use warnings and the <code>strict</code> pragma.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="unicode_in_perl_on_ebcdic">Unicode in Perl on EBCDIC</a></h2>
<p>The way Unicode is handled on EBCDIC platforms is still
experimental.  On such platforms, references to UTF-8 encoding in this
document and elsewhere should be read as meaning the UTF-EBCDIC
specified in Unicode Technical Report 16, unless ASCII vs. EBCDIC issues
are specifically discussed. There is no <code>utfebcdic</code> pragma or
&quot;:utfebcdic&quot; layer; rather, &quot;utf8&quot; and &quot;:utf8&quot; are reused to mean
the platform's &quot;natural&quot; 8-bit encoding of Unicode. See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlebcdic.html">the perlebcdic manpage</a>

<h2><a name="when_unicode_does_not_happen">When Unicode Does Not Happen</a></h2>
<p>While Perl does have extensive ways to input and output in Unicode,
and a few other &quot;entry points&quot; like the @ARGV array (which can sometimes be
interpreted as UTF-8), there are still many places where Unicode
(in some encoding or another) could be given as arguments or received as
results, or both, but it is not.</p>
<p>The following are such interfaces.  Also, see <a href="#the_unicode_bug">The &quot;Unicode Bug</a>.
For all of these interfaces Perl
currently (as of 5.8.3) simply assumes byte strings both as arguments
and results, or UTF-8 strings if the (problematic) <code>encoding</code> pragma has been used.</p>
<p>One reason that Perl does not attempt to resolve the role of Unicode in
these situations is that the answers are highly dependent on the operating
system and the file system(s).  For example, whether filenames can be
in Unicode and in exactly what kind of encoding, is not exactly a
portable concept.  Similarly for <code>qx</code> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#system"><code>system</code></a>: how well will the
&quot;command-line interface&quot; (and which of them?) handle Unicode?</p>

<h2><a name="the_unicode_bug">The &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;</a></h2>
<p>The term, the &quot;Unicode bug&quot; has been applied to an inconsistency
on ASCII platforms with the
Unicode code points in the Latin-1 Supplement block, that
is, between 128 and 255.  Without a locale specified, unlike all other
characters or code points, these characters have very different semantics in
byte semantics versus character semantics, unless
<code>use feature 'unicode_strings'</code> is specified.
(The lesson here is to specify <code>unicode_strings</code> to avoid the
headaches.)</p>
<p>In character semantics they are interpreted as Unicode code points, which means
they have the same semantics as Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).</p>
<p>In byte semantics, they are considered to be unassigned characters, meaning
that the only semantics they have is their ordinal numbers, and that they are
not members of various character classes.  None are considered to match <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\w</code></a>
for example, but all match <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\W</code></a>.</p>
<p>The behavior is known to have effects on these areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changing the case of a scalar, that is, using <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#uc"><code>uc()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ucfirst"><code>ucfirst()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lc"><code>lc()</code></a>,
and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lcfirst"><code>lcfirst()</code></a>, or <code>\L</code>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\U</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#u"><code>\u</code></a> and <code>\l</code> in regular expression
substitutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using caseless (<code>/i</code>) regular expression matching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matching any of several properties in regular expressions, namely <a href="../../lib/pods/perlguts.html#b"><code>\b</code></a>,
<code>\B</code>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#s"><code>\s</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#s"><code>\S</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\w</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\W</code></a>, and all the Posix character classes
<em>except</em> <code>[[:ascii:]]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#quotemeta"><code>quotemeta</code></a> or its inline equivalent <code>\Q</code>, no characters
code points above 127 are quoted in UTF-8 encoded strings, but in
byte encoded strings, code points between 128-255 are always quoted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User-defined case change mappings.  You can create a <code>ToUpper()</code> function, for
example, which overrides Perl's built-in case mappings.  The scalar must be
encoded in utf8 for your function to actually be invoked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior can lead to unexpected results in which a string's semantics
suddenly change if a code point above 255 is appended to or removed from it,
which changes the string's semantics from byte to character or vice versa.  As
an example, consider the following program and its output:</p>
<pre>
 <span class="operator">$ </span><span class="variable">perl</span> <span class="operator">-</span><span class="keyword">le</span><span class="string">'
     no feature '</span><span class="variable">unicode_strings</span><span class="string">';
     $s1 = "\xC2";
     $s2 = "\x{2660}";
     for ($s1, $s2, $s1.$s2) {
         print /\w/ || 0;
     }
 '</span>
 <span class="number">0</span>
 <span class="number">0</span>
 <span class="number">1</span>
</pre>
<p>If there's no <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#w"><code>\w</code></a> in <code>s1</code> or in <code>s2</code>, why does their concatenation have one?</p>
<p>This anomaly stems from Perl's attempt to not disturb older programs that
didn't use Unicode, and hence had no semantics for characters outside of the
ASCII range (except in a locale), along with Perl's desire to add Unicode
support seamlessly.  The result wasn't seamless: these characters were
orphaned.</p>
<p>Starting in Perl 5.14, <code>use feature 'unicode_strings'</code> can be used to
cause Perl to use Unicode semantics on all string operations within the
scope of the feature subpragma.  Regular expressions compiled in its
scope retain that behavior even when executed or compiled into larger
regular expressions outside the scope.  (The pragma does not, however,
affect the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#quotemeta"><code>quotemeta</code></a> behavior.  Nor does it affect the deprecated
user-defined case changing operations--these still require a UTF-8
encoded string to operate.)</p>
<p>In Perl 5.12, the subpragma affected casing changes, but not regular
expressions.  See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#lc">lc in the perlfunc manpage</a> for details on how this pragma works in
combination with various others for casing.</p>
<p>For earlier Perls, or when a string is passed to a function outside the
subpragma's scope, a workaround is to always call <code>utf8::upgrade($string)</code>,
or to use the standard module <a href="../../lib/Encode.html">the Encode manpage</a>.   Also, a scalar that has any characters
whose ordinal is above 0x100, or which were specified using either of the
<code>\N{...}</code> notations, will automatically have character semantics.</p>
<p>

<h2><a name="forcing_unicode_in_perl__or_unforcing_unicode_in_perl_">Forcing Unicode in Perl (Or Unforcing Unicode in Perl)</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes (see <a href="#when_unicode_does_not_happen">When Unicode Does Not Happen</a> or <a href="#the_unicode_bug">The &quot;Unicode Bug</a>)
there are situations where you simply need to force a byte
string into UTF-8, or vice versa.  The low-level calls
utf8::upgrade($bytestring) and utf8::downgrade($utf8string[, FAIL_OK]) are
the answers.</p>
<p>Note that utf8::downgrade() can fail if the string contains characters
that don't fit into a byte.</p>
<p>Calling either function on a string that already is in the desired state is a
no-op.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="using_unicode_in_xs">Using Unicode in XS</a></h2>
<p>If you want to handle Perl Unicode in XS extensions, you may find the
following C APIs useful.  See also <a href="../../lib/pods/perlguts.html#unicode_support">Unicode Support in the perlguts manpage</a> for an
explanation about Unicode at the XS level, and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlapi.html">the perlapi manpage</a> for the API
details.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>DO_UTF8(sv)</code> returns true if the <code>UTF8</code> flag is on and the bytes
pragma is not in effect.  <code>SvUTF8(sv)</code> returns true if the <code>UTF8</code>
flag is on; the bytes pragma is ignored.  The <code>UTF8</code> flag being on
does <strong>not</strong> mean that there are any characters of code points greater
than 255 (or 127) in the scalar or that there are even any characters
in the scalar.  What the <code>UTF8</code> flag means is that the sequence of
octets in the representation of the scalar is the sequence of UTF-8
encoded code points of the characters of a string.  The <code>UTF8</code> flag
being off means that each octet in this representation encodes a
single character with code point 0..255 within the string.  Perl's
Unicode model is not to use UTF-8 until it is absolutely necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>uvchr_to_utf8(buf, chr)</code> writes a Unicode character code point into
a buffer encoding the code point as UTF-8, and returns a pointer
pointing after the UTF-8 bytes.  It works appropriately on EBCDIC machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>utf8_to_uvchr(buf, lenp)</code> reads UTF-8 encoded bytes from a buffer and
returns the Unicode character code point and, optionally, the length of
the UTF-8 byte sequence.  It works appropriately on EBCDIC machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>utf8_length(start, end)</code> returns the length of the UTF-8 encoded buffer
in characters.  <code>sv_len_utf8(sv)</code> returns the length of the UTF-8 encoded
scalar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sv_utf8_upgrade(sv)</code> converts the string of the scalar to its UTF-8
encoded form.  <code>sv_utf8_downgrade(sv)</code> does the opposite, if
possible.  <code>sv_utf8_encode(sv)</code> is like sv_utf8_upgrade except that
it does not set the <code>UTF8</code> flag.  <code>sv_utf8_decode()</code> does the
opposite of <code>sv_utf8_encode()</code>.  Note that none of these are to be
used as general-purpose encoding or decoding interfaces: <code>use Encode</code>
for that.  <code>sv_utf8_upgrade()</code> is affected by the encoding pragma
but <code>sv_utf8_downgrade()</code> is not (since the encoding pragma is
designed to be a one-way street).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>is_utf8_char(s)</code> returns true if the pointer points to a valid UTF-8
character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>is_utf8_string(buf, len)</code> returns true if <code>len</code> bytes of the buffer
are valid UTF-8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>UTF8SKIP(buf)</code> will return the number of bytes in the UTF-8 encoded
character in the buffer.  <code>UNISKIP(chr)</code> will return the number of bytes
required to UTF-8-encode the Unicode character code point.  <code>UTF8SKIP()</code>
is useful for example for iterating over the characters of a UTF-8
encoded buffer; <code>UNISKIP()</code> is useful, for example, in computing
the size required for a UTF-8 encoded buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>utf8_distance(a, b)</code> will tell the distance in characters between the
two pointers pointing to the same UTF-8 encoded buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>utf8_hop(s, off)</code> will return a pointer to a UTF-8 encoded buffer
that is <code>off</code> (positive or negative) Unicode characters displaced
from the UTF-8 buffer <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#s"><code>s</code></a>.  Be careful not to overstep the buffer:
<code>utf8_hop()</code> will merrily run off the end or the beginning of the
buffer if told to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pv_uni_display(dsv, spv, len, pvlim, flags)</code> and
<code>sv_uni_display(dsv, ssv, pvlim, flags)</code> are useful for debugging the
output of Unicode strings and scalars.  By default they are useful
only for debugging--they display <strong>all</strong> characters as hexadecimal code
points--but with the flags <code>UNI_DISPLAY_ISPRINT</code>,
<code>UNI_DISPLAY_BACKSLASH</code>, and <code>UNI_DISPLAY_QQ</code> you can make the
output more readable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>foldEQ_utf8(s1, pe1, l1, u1, s2, pe2, l2, u2)</code> can be used to
compare two strings case-insensitively in Unicode.  For case-sensitive
comparisons you can just use <code>memEQ()</code> and <code>memNE()</code> as usual, except
if one string is in utf8 and the other isn't.</p>
</li>

<p>Perl by default comes with the latest supported Unicode version built in, but
you can change to use any earlier one.</p>
<p>Download the files in the desired version of Unicode from the Unicode web
site <a href="http://www.unicode.org">http://www.unicode.org</a>).  These should replace the existing files in
<em class="file">lib/unicore</em> in the Perl source tree.  Follow the instructions in
<em class="file">README.perl</em> in that directory to change some of their names, and then build
perl (see <em class="file">INSTALL</em>).</p>
<p>It is even possible to copy the built files to a different directory, and then
change <em class="file">utf8_heavy.pl</em> in the directory <code>$Config{privlib}</code> to point to the
new directory, or maybe make a copy of that directory before making the change,
and using <a href="../../lib/pods/perlvar.html#_inc"><code>@INC</code></a> or the <code>-I</code> run-time flag to switch between versions at will
(but because of caching, not in the middle of a process), but all this is

<h2><a name="interaction_with_extensions">Interaction with Extensions</a></h2>
<p>When Perl exchanges data with an extension, the extension should be
able to understand the UTF8 flag and act accordingly. If the
extension doesn't recognize that flag, it's likely that the extension
will return incorrectly-flagged data.</p>
<p>So if you're working with Unicode data, consult the documentation of
every module you're using if there are any issues with Unicode data
exchange. If the documentation does not talk about Unicode at all,
suspect the worst and probably look at the source to learn how the
module is implemented. Modules written completely in Perl shouldn't
cause problems. Modules that directly or indirectly access code written
in other programming languages are at risk.</p>
<p>For affected functions, the simple strategy to avoid data corruption is
to always make the encoding of the exchanged data explicit. Choose an
encoding that you know the extension can handle. Convert arguments passed
to the extensions to that encoding and convert results back from that
encoding. Write wrapper functions that do the conversions for you, so
you can later change the functions when the extension catches up.</p>
<p>To provide an example, let's say the popular Foo::Bar::escape_html
function doesn't deal with Unicode data yet. The wrapper function
would convert the argument to raw UTF-8 and convert the result back to
Perl's internal representation like so:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> my_escape_html </span><span class="operator">(</span>$<span class="operator">)</span> <span class="operator">{</span>
        <span class="keyword">my</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$what</span><span class="operator">)</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">shift</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">unless</span> <span class="keyword">defined</span> <span class="variable">$what</span><span class="operator">;</span>
        <span class="variable">Encode::decode_utf8</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">Foo::Bar::escape_html</span><span class="operator">(</span>
                                         <span class="variable">Encode::encode_utf8</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$what</span><span class="operator">)));</span>
    <span class="operator">}</span>
</pre>
<p>Sometimes, when the extension does not convert data but just stores
and retrieves them, you will be able to use the otherwise
dangerous Encode::_utf8_on() function. Let's say the popular
<code>Foo::Bar</code> extension, written in C, provides a <code>param</code> method that
lets you store and retrieve data according to these prototypes:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="variable">$self</span><span class="operator">-&gt;</span><span class="variable">param</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$name</span><span class="operator">,</span> <span class="variable">$value</span><span class="operator">);</span>            <span class="comment"># set a scalar</span>
    <span class="variable">$value</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="variable">$self</span><span class="operator">-&gt;</span><span class="variable">param</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$name</span><span class="operator">);</span>           <span class="comment"># retrieve a scalar</span>
</pre>
<p>If it does not yet provide support for any encoding, one could write a
derived class with such a <code>param</code> method:</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">sub</span><span class="variable"> param </span><span class="operator">{</span>
      <span class="keyword">my</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$self</span><span class="operator">,</span><span class="variable">$name</span><span class="operator">,</span><span class="variable">$value</span><span class="operator">)</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="variable">@_</span><span class="operator">;</span>

</pre>
<p>Some extensions provide filters on data entry/exit points, such as
DB_File::filter_store_key and family. Look out for such filters in
the documentation of your extensions, they can make the transition to
Unicode data much easier.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="speed">Speed</a></h2>
<p>Some functions are slower when working on UTF-8 encoded strings than
on byte encoded strings.  All functions that need to hop over
characters such as <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#length"><code>length()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlvar.html#substr"><code>substr()</code></a> or <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#index"><code>index()</code></a>, or matching regular
expressions can work <strong>much</strong> faster when the underlying data are
byte-encoded.</p>
<p>In Perl 5.8.0 the slowness was often quite spectacular; in Perl 5.8.1
a caching scheme was introduced which will hopefully make the slowness
somewhat less spectacular, at least for some operations.  In general,
operations with UTF-8 encoded strings are still slower. As an example,
the Unicode properties (character classes) like <code>\p{Nd}</code> are known to
be quite a bit slower (5-20 times) than their simpler counterparts
like <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#d"><code>\d</code></a> (then again, there are hundreds of Unicode characters matching <code>Nd</code>
compared with the 10 ASCII characters matching <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#d"><code>d</code></a>).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="problems_on_ebcdic_platforms">Problems on EBCDIC platforms</a></h2>
<p>There are several known problems with Perl on EBCDIC platforms.  If you
want to use Perl there, send email to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org.">perlbug@perl.org.</a></p>
<p>In earlier versions, when byte and character data were concatenated,
the new string was sometimes created by
decoding the byte strings as <em>ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)</em>, even if the
old Unicode string used EBCDIC.</p>
<p>If you find any of these, please report them as bugs.</p>

<h2><a name="porting_code_from_perl_5_6_x">Porting code from perl-5.6.X</a></h2>
<p>Perl 5.8 has a different Unicode model from 5.6. In 5.6 the programmer
was required to use the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#utf8"><code>utf8</code></a> pragma to declare that a given scope
expected to deal with Unicode data and had to make sure that only
Unicode data were reaching that scope. If you have code that is
working with 5.6, you will need some of the following adjustments to
your code. The examples are written such that the code will continue
to work under 5.6, so you should be safe to try them out.</p>

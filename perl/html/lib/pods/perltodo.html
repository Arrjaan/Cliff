<p>perltodo - Perl TO-DO List</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This is a list of wishes for Perl. The most up to date version of this file
is at <a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/pod/perltodo.pod">http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/pod/perltodo.pod</a></p>
<p>The tasks we think are smaller or easier are listed first. Anyone is welcome
to work on any of these, but it's a good idea to first contact
<em><a href="mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org">perl5-porters@perl.org</a></em> to avoid duplication of effort, and to learn from
any previous attempts. By all means contact a pumpking privately first if you
prefer.</p>
<p>Whilst patches to make the list shorter are most welcome, ideas to add to
the list are also encouraged. Check the perl5-porters archives for past
ideas, and any discussion about them. One set of archives may be found at
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/</a></p>
<p>What can we offer you in return? Fame, fortune, and everlasting glory? Maybe
not, but if your patch is incorporated, then we'll add your name to the
<em class="file">AUTHORS</em> file, which ships in the official distribution. How many other
programming languages offer you 1 line of immortality?</p>

<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="migrate_t__from_custom_tap_generation">Migrate t/ from custom TAP generation</a></h2>
<p>Many tests below <em class="file">t/</em> still generate TAP by &quot;hand&quot;, rather than using library
functions. As explained in <a href="../../lib/pods/perlhack.html#testing">TESTING in the perlhack manpage</a>, tests in <em class="file">t/</em> are
written in a particular way to test that more complex constructions actually
work before using them routinely. Hence they don't use <code>Test::More</code>, but
instead there is an intentionally simpler library, <em class="file">t/test.pl</em>. However,
quite a few tests in <em class="file">t/</em> have not been refactored to use it. Refactoring
any of these tests, one at a time, is a useful thing TODO.</p>
<p>The subdirectories <em class="file">base</em>, <em class="file">cmd</em> and <em class="file">comp</em>, that contain the most
basic tests, should be excluded from this task.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="automate_perldelta_generation">Automate perldelta generation</a></h2>
<p>The perldelta file accompanying each release summaries the major changes.
It's mostly manually generated currently, but some of that could be
automated with a bit of perl, specifically the generation of</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="modules_and_pragmata48" class="item">Modules and Pragmata</a></strong></dt>

<dt><strong><a name="new_documentation20" class="item">New Documentation</a></strong></dt>

<dt><strong><a name="new_tests14" class="item">New Tests</a></strong></dt>

</dl>
<p>See <em class="file">Porting/how_to_write_a_perldelta.pod</em> for details.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="remove_duplication_of_test_setup_">Remove duplication of test setup.</a></h2>
<p>Schwern notes, that there's duplication of code - lots and lots of tests have
some variation on the big block of <code>$Is_Foo</code> checks.  We can safely put this
into a file, change it to build an <code>%Is</code> hash and require it.  Maybe just put
it into <em class="file">test.pl</em>. Throw in the handy tainting subroutines.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="pod____html_conversion_in_the_core_still_sucks">POD -&gt; HTML conversion in the core still sucks</a></h2>
<p>Which is crazy given just how simple POD purports to be, and how simple HTML
can be. It's not actually <em>as</em> simple as it sounds, particularly with the
flexibility POD allows for <code>=item</code>, but it would be good to improve the
visual appeal of the HTML generated, and to avoid it having any validation
errors. See also <a href="#make_html_install_work">make HTML install work</a>, as the layout of installation tree
is needed to improve the cross-linking.</p>
<p>The addition of <code>Pod::Simple</code> and its related modules may make this task
easier to complete.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="make_extutils__parsexs_use_strict_">Make ExtUtils::ParseXS use strict;</a></h2>
<p><em class="file">lib/ExtUtils/ParseXS.pm</em> contains this line</p>
<pre>
    <span class="comment"># use strict;  # One of these days...</span>
</pre>
<p>Simply uncomment it, and fix all the resulting issues :-)</p>
<p>The more practical approach, to break the task down into manageable chunks, is
to work your way though the code from bottom to top, or if necessary adding
extra <code>{ ... }</code> blocks, and turning on strict within them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="make_schwern_poorer">Make Schwern poorer</a></h2>
<p>We should have tests for everything. When all the core's modules are tested,
Schwern has promised to donate to $500 to TPF. We may need volunteers to
hold him upside down and shake vigorously in order to actually extract the
cash.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="improve_the_coverage_of_the_core_tests">Improve the coverage of the core tests</a></h2>
<p>Use Devel::Cover to ascertain the core modules' test coverage, then add
tests that are currently missing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="test_b">test B</a></h2>
<p>A full test suite for the B module would be nice.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="a_decent_benchmark">A decent benchmark</a></h2>
<p><code>perlbench</code> seems impervious to any recent changes made to the perl core. It
would be useful to have a reasonable general benchmarking suite that roughly
represented what current perl programs do, and measurably reported whether
tweaks to the core improve, degrade or don't really affect performance, to
guide people attempting to optimise the guts of perl. Gisle would welcome
new tests for perlbench.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="fix_tainting_bugs">fix tainting bugs</a></h2>
<p>Fix the bugs revealed by running the test suite with the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#t"><code>-t</code></a> switch (via
<code>make test.taintwarn</code>).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="dual_life_everything">Dual life everything</a></h2>
<p>As part of the &quot;dists&quot; plan, anything that doesn't belong in the smallest perl
distribution needs to be dual lifed. Anything else can be too. Figure out what
changes would be needed to package that module and its tests up for CPAN, and
do so. Test it with older perl releases, and fix the problems you find.</p>
<p>To make a minimal perl distribution, it's useful to look at
<em class="file">t/lib/commonsense.t</em>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="posix_memory_footprint">POSIX memory footprint</a></h2>
<p>Ilya observed that use POSIX; eats memory like there's no tomorrow, and at
various times worked to cut it down. There is probably still fat to cut out -
for example POSIX passes Exporter some very memory hungry data structures.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="embed_pl_makedef_pl">embed.pl/makedef.pl</a></h2>
<p>There is a script <em class="file">embed.pl</em> that generates several header files to prefix
all of Perl's symbols in a consistent way, to provide some semblance of
namespace support in <code>C</code>. Functions are declared in <em class="file">embed.fnc</em>, variables
in <em class="file">interpvar.h</em>. Quite a few of the functions and variables
are conditionally declared there, using <code>#ifdef</code>. However, <em class="file">embed.pl</em>
doesn't understand the C macros, so the rules about which symbols are present
when is duplicated in <em class="file">makedef.pl</em>. Writing things twice is bad, m'kay.
It would be good to teach <code>embed.pl</code> to understand the conditional
compilation, and hence remove the duplication, and the mistakes it has caused.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="use_strict__and_autoload">use strict; and AutoLoad</a></h2>
<p>Currently if you write</p>
<pre>
    <span class="keyword">package</span> <span class="variable">Whack</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">AutoLoader</span> <span class="string">'AUTOLOAD'</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">strict</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="number">1</span><span class="operator">;</span>
    <span class="comment">__END__
    sub bloop {
        print join (' ', No, strict, here), "!\n";
    }
    </span>
</pre>
<p>then <code>use strict;</code> isn't in force within the autoloaded subroutines. It would
be more consistent (and less surprising) to arrange for all lexical pragmas
in force at the __END__ block to be in force within each autoloaded subroutine.</p>
<p>There's a similar problem with SelfLoader.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="profile_installman">profile installman</a></h2>
<p>The <em class="file">installman</em> script is slow. All it is doing text processing, which we're
told is something Perl is good at. So it would be nice to know what it is doing
that is taking so much CPU, and where possible address it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="enable_lexical_enabling_disabling_of_individual_warnings">enable lexical enabling/disabling of individual warnings</a></h2>
<p>Currently, warnings can only be enabled or disabled by category. There
are times when it would be useful to quash a single warning, not a
whole category.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="tasks_that_need_a_little_sysadmin_type_knowledge">Tasks that need a little sysadmin-type knowledge</a></h1>
<p>Or if you prefer, tasks that you would learn from, and broaden your skills
base...</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="make_html_install_work">make HTML install work</a></h2>
<p>There is an <code>installhtml</code> target in the Makefile. It's marked as
&quot;experimental&quot;. It would be good to get this tested, make it work reliably, and
remove the &quot;experimental&quot; tag. This would include</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Checking that cross linking between various parts of the documentation works.
In particular that links work between the modules (files with POD in <em class="file">lib/</em>)
and the core documentation (files in <em class="file">pod/</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work out how to split <code>perlfunc</code> into chunks, preferably one per function
group, preferably with general case code that could be used elsewhere.
Challenges here are correctly identifying the groups of functions that go
together, and making the right named external cross-links point to the right
page. Things to be aware of are <a href="../../lib/pods/perlrun.html#x"><code>-X</code></a>, groups such as <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#getpwnam"><code>getpwnam</code></a> to
<a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#endservent"><code>endservent</code></a>, two or more <code>=items</code> giving the different parameter lists, such
as</p>
<pre>
    =item substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH,REPLACEMENT
    =item substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH
    =item substr EXPR,OFFSET</pre>
<p>and different parameter lists having different meanings. (eg <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#select"><code>select</code></a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="compressed_man_pages">compressed man pages</a></h2>
<p>Be able to install them. This would probably need a configure test to see how
the system does compressed man pages (same directory/different directory?
same filename/different filename), as well as tweaking the <em class="file">installman</em> script
to compress as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="add_a_code_coverage_target_to_the_makefile">Add a code coverage target to the Makefile</a></h2>
<p>Make it easy for anyone to run Devel::Cover on the core's tests. The steps
to do this manually are roughly</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>do a normal <code>Configure</code>, but include Devel::Cover as a module to install
(see <em>INSTALL</em> for how to do this)</p>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
    make perl</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
    <span class="variable">cd</span> <span class="variable">t</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="variable">HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES</span><span class="operator">=-</span><span class="variable">MDevel::Cover</span> <span class="operator">.</span><span class="regex">/perl -I../lib</span> <span class="variable">harness</span>
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process the resulting Devel::Cover database</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This just give you the coverage of the <em class="file">.pm</em>s. To also get the C level
coverage you need to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Additionally tell <code>Configure</code> to use the appropriate C compiler flags for
<code>gcov</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
    make perl.gcov</pre>
<p>(instead of <code>make perl</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After running the tests run <code>gcov</code> to generate all the <em class="file">.gcov</em> files.
(Including down in the subdirectories of <em class="file">ext/</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(From the top level perl directory) run <code>gcov2perl</code> on all the <code>.gcov</code> files
to get their stats into the cover_db directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then process the Devel::Cover database</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be good to add a single switch to <code>Configure</code> to specify that you
wanted to perform perl level coverage, and another to specify C level
coverage, and have <code>Configure</code> and the <em class="file">Makefile</em> do all the right things
automatically.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="make_config_pm_cope_with_differences_between_built_and_installed_perl">Make Config.pm cope with differences between built and installed perl</a></h2>
<p>Quite often vendors ship a perl binary compiled with their (pay-for)
compilers.  People install a free compiler, such as gcc. To work out how to
build extensions, Perl interrogates <code>%Config</code>, so in this situation
<code>%Config</code> describes compilers that aren't there, and extension building
fails. This forces people into choosing between re-compiling perl themselves
using the compiler they have, or only using modules that the vendor ships.</p>
<p>It would be good to find a way teach <code>Config.pm</code> about the installation setup,
possibly involving probing at install time or later, so that the <code>%Config</code> in
a binary distribution better describes the installed machine, when the
installed machine differs from the build machine in some significant way.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="linker_specification_files">linker specification files</a></h2>
<p>Some platforms mandate that you provide a list of a shared library's external
symbols to the linker, so the core already has the infrastructure in place to
do this for generating shared perl libraries. My understanding is that the
GNU toolchain can accept an optional linker specification file, and restrict
visibility just to symbols declared in that file. It would be good to extend
<em class="file">makedef.pl</em> to support this format, and to provide a means within
<code>Configure</code> to enable it. This would allow Unix users to test that the
export list is correct, and to build a perl that does not pollute the global
namespace with private symbols, and will fail in the same way as msvc or mingw 
builds or when using PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="cross_compile_support">Cross-compile support</a></h2>
<p>Currently <code>Configure</code> understands <code>-Dusecrosscompile</code> option. This option
arranges for building <code>miniperl</code> for TARGET machine, so this <code>miniperl</code> is
assumed then to be copied to TARGET machine and used as a replacement of full
<code>perl</code> executable.</p>
<p>This could be done little differently. Namely <code>miniperl</code> should be built for
HOST and then full <code>perl</code> with extensions should be compiled for TARGET.
This, however, might require extra trickery for %Config: we have one config
first for HOST and then another for TARGET.  Tools like MakeMaker will be
mightily confused.  Having around two different types of executables and
libraries (HOST and TARGET) makes life interesting for Makefiles and
shell (and Perl) scripts.  There is $Config{run}, normally empty, which
can be used as an execution wrapper.  Also note that in some
cross-compilation/execution environments the HOST and the TARGET do
not see the same filesystem(s), the $Config{run} may need to do some
file/directory copying back and forth.</p>

<h2><a name="split_linker_from_compiler">Split &quot;linker&quot; from &quot;compiler&quot;</a></h2>
<p>Right now, Configure probes for two commands, and sets two variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="cc" class="item"><code>cc</code> (in <em class="file">cc.U</em>)</a></strong>

<p>This variable holds the name of a command to execute a C compiler which
can resolve multiple global references that happen to have the same
name.  Usual values are <em class="file">cc</em> and <em class="file">gcc</em>.
Fervent ANSI compilers may be called <em class="file">c89</em>.  AIX has <em class="file">xlc</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong><a name="ld" class="item"><code>ld</code> (in <em class="file">dlsrc.U</em>)</a></strong>

<p>This variable indicates the program to be used to link
libraries for dynamic loading.  On some systems, it is <em class="file">ld</em>.
On ELF systems, it should be <code>$cc</code>.  Mostly, we'll try to respect
the hint file setting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an implicit historical assumption from around Perl5.000alpha
something, that <code>$cc</code> is also the correct command for linking object files
together to make an executable. This may be true on Unix, but it's not true
on other platforms, and there are a maze of work arounds in other places (such
as <em class="file">Makefile.SH</em>) to cope with this.</p>
<p>Ideally, we should create a new variable to hold the name of the executable
linker program, probe for it in <em class="file">Configure</em>, and centralise all the special
case logic there or in hints files.</p>
<p>A small bikeshed issue remains - what to call it, given that <code>$ld</code> is already
taken (arguably for the wrong thing now, but on SunOS 4.1 it is the command
for creating dynamically-loadable modules) and <code>$link</code> could be confused with
the Unix command line executable of the same name, which does something
completely different. Andy Dougherty makes the counter argument &quot;In parrot, I
tried to call the command used to link object files and  libraries into an
executable <em class="file">link</em>, since that's what my vaguely-remembered DOS and VMS
experience suggested. I don't think any real confusion has ensued, so it's
probably a reasonable name for perl5 to use.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas, I've always worried that introducing it would make things worse, 
since now the module building utilities would have to look for 
<code>$Config{link}</code> and institute a fall-back plan if it weren't found.&quot;
Although I can see that as confusing, given that <code>$Config{d_link}</code> is true
when (hard) links are available.</p>

<h2><a name="configure_windows_using_powershell">Configure Windows using PowerShell</a></h2>
<p>Currently, Windows uses hard-coded config files based to build the
config.h for compiling Perl.  Makefiles are also hard-coded and need to be 
hand edited prior to building Perl. While this makes it easy to create a perl.exe 
that works across multiple Windows versions, being able to accurately
configure a perl.exe for a specific Windows versions and VS C++ would be
a nice enhancement.  With PowerShell available on Windows XP and up, this 
may now be possible.  Step 1 might be to investigate whether this is possible
and use this to clean up our current makefile situation.  Step 2 would be to 
see if there would be a way to use our existing metaconfig units to configure a
Windows Perl or whether we go in a separate direction and make it so.  Of 
course, we all know what step 3 is.</p>

<h2><a name="decouple__g_and__ddebugging">decouple -g and -DDEBUGGING</a></h2>
<p>Currently <em class="file">Configure</em> automatically adds <code>-DDEBUGGING</code> to the C compiler
flags if it spots <code>-g</code> in the optimiser flags. The pre-processor directive
<code>DEBUGGING</code> enables <em class="file">perl</em>'s command line <code>-D</code> options, but in the process
makes <em class="file">perl</em> slower. It would be good to disentangle this logic, so that
C-level debugging with <code>-g</code> and Perl level debugging with <code>-D</code> can easily
be enabled independently.</p>

<p>Natively 64-bit systems need neither -Duse64bitint nor -Duse64bitall.
On these systems, it might be the default compilation mode, and there

<h2><a name="profile_perl___am_i_hot_or_not">Profile Perl - am I hot or not?</a></h2>
<p>The Perl source code is stable enough that it makes sense to profile it,
identify and optimise the hotspots. It would be good to measure the
performance of the Perl interpreter using free tools such as cachegrind,
gprof, and dtrace, and work to reduce the bottlenecks they reveal.</p>
<p>As part of this, the idea of <em class="file">pp_hot.c</em> is that it contains the <em>hot</em> ops,
the ops that are most commonly used. The idea is that by grouping them, their
object code will be adjacent in the executable, so they have a greater chance
of already being in the CPU cache (or swapped in) due to being near another op
already in use.</p>
<p>Except that it's not clear if these really are the most commonly used ops. So
as part of exercising your skills with coverage and profiling tools you might
want to determine what ops <em>really</em> are the most commonly used. And in turn
suggest evictions and promotions to achieve a better <em class="file">pp_hot.c</em>.</p>
<p>One piece of Perl code that might make a good testbed is <em class="file">installman</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="allocate_ops_from_arenas">Allocate OPs from arenas</a></h2>
<p>Currently all new OP structures are individually malloc()ed and free()d.
All <code>malloc</code> implementations have space overheads, and are now as fast as
custom allocates so it would both use less memory and less CPU to allocate
the various OP structures from arenas. The SV arena code can probably be
re-used for this.</p>
<p>Note that Configuring perl with <code>-Accflags=-DPL_OP_SLAB_ALLOC</code> will use
<code>Perl_Slab_alloc()</code> to pack optrees into a contiguous block, which is
probably superior to the use of OP arenas, esp. from a cache locality
standpoint.  See <a href="#profile_perl___am_i_hot_or_not">Profile Perl - am I hot or not?</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, the warnings about these deprecations have been disabled by adding
-D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE to the CFLAGS. It would be nice to remove that
warning suppressant and actually make use of the new secure CRT functions.</p>
<p>There is also a similar issue with POSIX CRT function names like fileno having
been deprecated in favour of ISO C++ conformant names like _fileno. These
warnings are also currently suppressed by adding -D_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE. It
might be nice to do as Microsoft suggest here too, although, unlike the secure

<h2><a name="fix_posix__access___and_chdir___on_win32">Fix POSIX::access() and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chdir"><code>chdir()</code></a> on Win32</a></h2>
<p>These functions currently take no account of DACLs and therefore do not behave
correctly in situations where access is restricted by DACLs (as opposed to the
read-only attribute).</p>
<p>Furthermore, POSIX::access() behaves differently for directories having the
read-only attribute set depending on what CRT library is being used. For
example, the <code>_access()</code> function in the VC6 and VC7 CRTs (wrongly) claim that
such directories are not writable, whereas in fact all directories are writable
unless access is denied by DACLs. (In the case of directories, the read-only
attribute actually only means that the directory cannot be deleted.) This CRT
bug is fixed in the VC8 and VC9 CRTs (but, of course, the directory may still
not actually be writable if access is indeed denied by DACLs).</p>
<p>For the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chdir"><code>chdir()</code></a> issue, see ActiveState bug #74552:
<a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi?id=74552">http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi</a></p>
<p>Therefore, DACLs should be checked both for consistency across CRTs and for
the correct answer.</p>
<p>(Note that perl's -w operator should not be modified to check DACLs. It has
been written so that it reflects the state of the read-only attribute, even
for directories (whatever CRT is being used), for symmetry with chmod().)</p>

probably aren't allocated/deallocated often enough for a speed saving. Whereas

<p>Deconstructing and explaining some simpler XS modules could be one way to

<h2><a name="remove_the_use_of_svs_as_temporaries_in_dump_c">Remove the use of SVs as temporaries in dump.c</a></h2>
<p><em class="file">dump.c</em> contains debugging routines to dump out the contains of perl data
structures, such as <code>SV</code>s, <code>AV</code>s and <code>HV</code>s. Currently, the dumping code
<strong>uses</strong> <code>SV</code>s for its temporary buffers, which was a logical initial
implementation choice, as they provide ready made memory handling.</p>
<p>However, they also lead to a lot of confusion when it happens that what you're
trying to debug is seen by the code in <em class="file">dump.c</em>, correctly or incorrectly, as
a temporary scalar it can use for a temporary buffer. It's also not possible
to dump scalars before the interpreter is properly set up, such as during
ithreads cloning. It would be good to progressively replace the use of scalars
as string accumulation buffers with something much simpler, directly allocated
by <code>malloc</code>. The <em class="file">dump.c</em> code is (or should be) only producing 7 bit
US-ASCII, so output character sets are not an issue.</p>
<p>Producing and proving an internal simple buffer allocation would make it easier
to re-write the internals of the PerlIO subsystem to avoid using <code>SV</code>s for
<strong>its</strong> buffers, use of which can cause problems similar to those of <em class="file">dump.c</em>,
at similar times.</p>

<h2><a name="safely_supporting_posix_sa_siginfo">safely supporting POSIX SA_SIGINFO</a></h2>
<p>Some years ago Jarkko supplied patches to provide support for the POSIX
SA_SIGINFO feature in Perl, passing the extra data to the Perl signal handler.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it only works with &quot;unsafe&quot; signals, because under safe
signals, by the time Perl gets to run the signal handler, the extra
information has been lost. Moreover, it's not easy to store it somewhere,
as you can't call mutexs, or do anything else fancy, from inside a signal
handler.</p>
<p>So it strikes me that we could provide safe SA_SIGINFO support</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Provide global variables for two file descriptors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the first request is made via <code>sigaction</code> for <code>SA_SIGINFO</code>, create a
pipe, store the reader in one, the writer in the other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the &quot;safe&quot; signal handler (<code>Perl_csighandler()</code>/<code>S_raise_signal()</code>), if
the <code>siginfo_t</code> pointer non-<code>NULL</code>, and the writer file handle is open,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>serialise signal number, <code>struct siginfo_t</code> (or at least the parts we care
about) into a small auto char buff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#write"><code>write()</code></a> that (non-blocking) to the writer fd</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>if it writes 100%, flag the signal in a counter of &quot;signals on the pipe&quot; akin
to the current per-signal-number counts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if it writes 0%, assume the pipe is full. Flag the data as lost?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if it writes partially, croak a panic, as your OS is broken.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the regular <code>PERL_ASYNC_CHECK()</code> processing, if there are &quot;signals on
the pipe&quot;, read the data out, deserialise, build the Perl structures on
the stack (code in <code>Perl_sighandler()</code>, the &quot;unsafe&quot; handler), and call as
usual.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that this gets us decent <code>SA_SIGINFO</code> support, without the current risk
of running Perl code inside the signal handler context. (With all the dangers
of things like <code>malloc</code> corruption that that currently offers us)</p>

<p>Known combinations that have some level of understanding include
Microsoft NTFS, Apple HFS+ (In Mac OS 9 and X) and Apple UFS (in Mac

create Unicode filenames, what forms of Unicode are accepted and used
(UCS-2, UTF-16, UTF-8), what (if any) is the normalization form used,
and so on, varies.  Finding the right level of interfacing to Perl
requires some thought.  Remember that an OS does not implicate a

<h2><a name="organize_error_messages">Organize error messages</a></h2>
<p>Perl's diagnostics (error messages, see <a href="../../lib/pods/perldiag.html">the perldiag manpage</a>) could use
reorganizing and formalizing so that each error message has its
stable-for-all-eternity unique id, categorized by severity, type, and
subsystem.  (The error messages would be listed in a datafile outside
of the Perl source code, and the source code would only refer to the
messages by the id.)  This clean-up and regularizing should apply
for all <code>croak()</code> messages.</p>
<p>This would enable all sorts of things: easier translation/localization
of the messages (though please do keep in mind the caveats of
<a href="../../lib/Locale/Maketext.html">the Locale::Maketext manpage</a> about too straightforward approaches to
translation), filtering by severity, and instead of grepping for a
particular error message one could look for a stable error id.  (Of
course, changing the error messages by default would break all the
existing software depending on some particular error message...)</p>
<p>This kind of functionality is known as <em>message catalogs</em>.  Look for
inspiration for example in the <code>catgets()</code> system, possibly even use it
if available-- but <strong>only</strong> if available, all platforms will <strong>not</strong>
have <code>catgets()</code>.</p>

candidates.  The whole Unicode database could be placed in-core for a

<p>The tokeniser isn't actually very UTF-8 clean. <code>use utf8;</code> is a hack -
variable names are stored in stashes as raw bytes, without the utf-8 flag

<h2><a name="virtualize_operating_system_access">Virtualize operating system access</a></h2>
<p>Implement a set of &quot;vtables&quot; that virtualizes operating system access
(open(), <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#mkdir"><code>mkdir()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#unlink"><code>unlink()</code></a>, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#readdir"><code>readdir()</code></a>, <code>getenv()</code>, etc.)  At the very
least these interfaces should take SVs as &quot;name&quot; arguments instead of
bare char pointers; probably the most flexible and extensible way
would be for the Perl-facing interfaces to accept HVs.  The system
needs to be per-operating-system and per-file-system
hookable/filterable, preferably both from XS and Perl level
(<a href="../../lib/pods/perlport.html#files_and_filesystems">Files and Filesystems in the perlport manpage</a> is good reading at this point,
in fact, all of <a href="../../lib/pods/perlport.html">the perlport manpage</a> is.)</p>
<p>This has actually already been implemented (but only for Win32),
take a look at <em class="file">iperlsys.h</em> and <em class="file">win32/perlhost.h</em>.  While all Win32
variants go through a set of &quot;vtables&quot; for operating system access,
non-Win32 systems currently go straight for the POSIX/Unix-style
system/library call.  Similar system as for Win32 should be
implemented for all platforms.  The existing Win32 implementation
probably does not need to survive alongside this proposed new
implementation, the approaches could be merged.</p>
<p>What would this give us?  One often-asked-for feature this would
enable is using Unicode for filenames, and other &quot;names&quot; like %ENV,
usernames, hostnames, and so forth.
(See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlunicode.html#when_unicode_does_not_happen">When Unicode Does Not Happen in the perlunicode manpage</a>.)</p>
<p>But this kind of virtualization would also allow for things like
virtual filesystems, virtual networks, and &quot;sandboxes&quot; (though as long
as dynamic loading of random object code is allowed, not very safe
sandboxes since external code of course know not of Perl's vtables).
An example of a smaller &quot;sandbox&quot; is that this feature can be used to
implement per-thread working directories: Win32 already does this.</p>

<h2><a name="store_the_current_pad_in_the_op_slab_allocator">Store the current pad in the OP slab allocator</a></h2>
<p>Currently we leak ops in various cases of parse failure. I suggested that we
could solve this by always using the op slab allocator, and walking it to
free ops. Dave comments that as some ops are already freed during optree
creation one would have to mark which ops are freed, and not double free them
when walking the slab. He notes that one problem with this is that for some ops
you have to know which pad was current at the time of allocation, which does
change. I suggested storing a pointer to the current pad in the memory allocated
for the slab, and swapping to a new slab each time the pad changes. Dave thinks
that this would work.</p>

<h2><a name="repack_the_optree">repack the optree</a></h2>
<p>Repacking the optree after execution order is determined could allow
removal of NULL ops, and optimal ordering of OPs with respect to cache-line
filling.  The slab allocator could be reused for this purpose.  I think that
the best way to do this is to make it an optional step just before the
completed optree is attached to anything else, and to use the slab allocator
unchanged, so that freeing ops is identical whether or not this step runs.
Note that the slab allocator allocates ops downwards in memory, so one would
have to actually &quot;allocate&quot; the ops in reverse-execution order to get them
contiguous in memory in execution order.</p>

<p>Note that running this copy, and then freeing all the old location ops would
cause their slabs to be freed, which would eliminate possible memory wastage if
the previous suggestion is implemented, and we swap slabs more frequently.</p>

<p>where the line of the second warning was misreported - it should be line 5.
Rafael fixed this - the problem arose because there was no nextstate OP
between the execution of the <code>if</code> and the <code>elsif</code>, hence <code>PL_curcop</code> still
reports that the currently executing line is line 4. The solution was to inject
a nextstate OPs for each <code>elsif</code>, although it turned out that the nextstate
OP needed to be a nulled OP, rather than a live nextstate OP, else other line
numbers became misreported. (Jenga!)</p>
<p>The problem is more general than <code>elsif</code> (although the <code>elsif</code> case is the
most common and the most confusing). Ideally this code</p>

    Use of uninitialized value $undef in addition (+) at wrong.pl line 7.</pre>
<p>(rather than lines 4 and 5), but this would seem to require every OP to carry
(at least) line number information.</p>
<p>What might work is to have an optional line number in memory just before the
BASEOP structure, with a flag bit in the op to say whether it's present.
Initially during compile every OP would carry its line number. Then add a late
pass to the optimiser (potentially combined with <a href="#repack_the_optree">repack the optree</a>) which
looks at the two ops on every edge of the graph of the execution path. If
the line number changes, flags the destination OP with this information.
Once all paths are traced, replace every op with the flag with a
nextstate-light op (that just updates <code>PL_curcop</code>), which in turn then passes
control on to the true op. All ops would then be replaced by variants that
do not store the line number. (Which, logically, why it would work best in
conjunction with <a href="#repack_the_optree">repack the optree</a>, as that is already copying/reallocating
all the OPs)</p>
<p>(Although I should note that we're not certain that doing this for the general
case is worth it)</p>

<h2><a name="optimize_tail_calls">optimize tail-calls</a></h2>
<p>Tail-calls present an opportunity for broadly applicable optimization;
anywhere that <code>return foo(...)</code> is called, the outer return can
be replaced by a goto, and foo will return directly to the outer
caller, saving (conservatively) 25% of perl's call&amp;return cost, which
is relatively higher than in C.  The scheme language is known to do
this heavily.  B::Concise provides good insight into where this
optimization is possible, ie anywhere entersub,leavesub op-sequence
occurs.</p>
<pre>
 <span class="variable">perl</span> <span class="operator">-</span><span class="variable">MO</span><span class="operator">=</span><span class="variable">Concise</span><span class="operator">,-</span><span class="keyword">exec</span><span class="operator">,</span><span class="variable">a</span><span class="operator">,</span><span class="variable">b</span><span class="operator">,-</span><span class="variable">main</span> <span class="keyword">-e</span> <span class="string">'sub a{ 1 }; sub b {a()}; b(2)'</span>
</pre>
<p>Bottom line on this is probably a new pp_tailcall function which
combines the code in pp_entersub, pp_leavesub.  This should probably
be done 1st in XS, and using B::Generate to patch the new OP into the
optrees.</p>

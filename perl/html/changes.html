<h2><a name="build_1400_may_11__2011">Build 1400 May 11, 2011</a></h2>
<p><em>What's new in the 1400 Series</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This build corresponds to the Perl 5.14.0 source code release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 1400 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with
builds in the 600, 800, 1000 or 1200 series.  Any extensions built using binaries
from the ActivePerl 600, 800, 1000 or 1200 series will need to be recompiled.
Note especially that this applies to PPM packages that may have been
built for 600, 800, 1000 or 1200 series builds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significant changes that have occurred in the 5.14.0 release
are documented in <a href="./lib/pods/perl5140delta.html">the perl5140delta manpage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to the latest ActivePerl in the 1200 series (ActivePerl 1204) the
following additional non-core CPAN distributions are now bundled:</p>
<pre>
    Encode-Locale
    Eval-Closure
    IO-Socket-SSL
    Mozilla-CA
    Net-SSLeay
    Package-Stash-XS
    PPIx-Regexp</pre>
<p>The libwww-perl distribution has been split into many smaller distributions
that are all included separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Crypt-SSLeay distribution is no longer bundled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ActivePerl 1400 series is built as 64-bit binaries on Mac OS X.
Since the Carbon API for Mac does not support 64-bit binaries
the distributions that depended on it are not longer bundled.
These were:</p>
<pre>
    Mac-AppleEvents-Simple
    Mac-Apps-Launch
    Mac-Carbon
    Mac-Glue
    Mac-OSA-Simple</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most bundled distributions have been updated to their latest released
version from CPAN.  Use the <code>ppm query</code> command to check the exact
version included in this release.</p>

=head1 NAME

Locale::Language - standard codes for language identification

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Locale::Language;

   $lang = code2language('en');        # $lang gets 'English'
   $code = language2code('French');    # $code gets 'fr'

   @codes   = all_language_codes();
   @names   = all_language_names();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exists as both Locale::Codes::Language and Locale::Language (for
historical reasons).  The Locale::Language module will continue to work.

The C<Locale::Language> module provides access to standard codes used
for identifying languages, such as those as defined in ISO 639.

Most of the routines take an optional additional argument which
specifies the code set to use. If not specified, the default ISO
639 two-letter codes will be used.

=head1 SUPPORTED CODE SETS

There are several different code sets you can use for identifying
languages. The ones currently supported are:

=over 4

=item B<alpha-2>

This is the set of two-letter (lowercase) codes from ISO 639-1, such
as 'he' for Hebrew.  It also includes additions to this set included
in the IANA language registry.

This code set is identified with the symbol C<LOCALE_LANG_ALPHA_2>.

This is the default code set.

=item B<alpha-3>

This is the set of three-letter (lowercase) bibliographic codes from
ISO 639-2 and 639-5, such as 'heb' for Hebrew.  It also includes
additions to this set included in the IANA language registry.

This code set is identified with the symbol C<LOCALE_LANG_ALPHA_3>.

=item B<term>

This is the set of three-letter (lowercase) terminologic codes from
ISO 639.

This code set is identified with the symbol C<LOCALE_LANG_TERM>.
